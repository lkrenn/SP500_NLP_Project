       "'ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  2020 Financial Overview Impact of Coronavirus (COVID-19)  COVID-19 has been declared a global health pandemic by the World Health Organization. COVID-19 has surfaced in nearly all regions of the world, which has driven  the  implementation of significant, government-imposed measures  to prevent or  reduce  its spread,  including  travel  restrictions,  testing regimes, closing of borders, “stay at home” orders and business closures. As a result, we have experienced an unprecedented decline in the demand for air travel, which has resulted in a material deterioration in our revenues. While our business performed largely as expected in January and February of 2020, a severe reduction in air travel starting in March 2020 resulted in our total operating revenues decreasing approximately 62% in 2020 as compared to 2019. While the  length and severity of  the reduction  in demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic  is uncertain, we expect our results of operations for 2021 to be severely impacted.  We have taken aggressive actions  to mitigate  the effects of  the COVID-19 pandemic on our business  including deep capacity  reductions, structural changes to our fleet, cost reductions, and steps to preserve cash and improve our overall liquidity position. We remain extremely focused on taking all self- help measures available to manage our business during this unprecedented time, consistent with the terms of the financial assistance we have received from  the U.S. Government under  the Coronavirus Aid, Relief,  and Economic Security Act  (CARES Act)  and Subtitle A of Title  IV of Division N of  the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (PSP Extension Law).  Capacity Reductions We  have  significantly  reduced  our  capacity  (as measured  by  available  seat miles),  with  2020  flying  decreasing  by  50%  year-over-year.  Domestic  capacity in 2020 was down 41% year-over-year while international capacity was down 68% year-over-year.  We also reset our international capacity and network for 2021 in response to the severe decline in demand. We have exited 19 international routes from six hubs. These changes will allow us to operate more efficiently when demand returns.  We currently expect our  first quarter 2021 system capacity  to decrease by 45% as compared to  the first quarter of 2019. The demand environment continues to be uncertain as COVID-19 cases have continued to fluctuate in jurisdictions to which we fly and travel restrictions have generally remained in place.  Due  to  this  uncertainty,  we  will  continue  to  adjust  our  future  capacity  to  match  observed  booking  trends  for  future  travel  and  make  further adjustments to our capacity as needed.  Fleet To better align our network with lower passenger demand, we accelerated the retirement of Airbus A330-200, Boeing 757, Boeing 767, Airbus A330-  300 and Embraer 190 fleets as well as certain regional aircraft, including certain Embraer 140 and Bombardier CRJ200 aircraft. These retirements remove complexity  from our operation and bring  forward  cost  savings and efficiencies associated with operating  fewer aircraft  types. See Note 1(g)  to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A for further information on the accounting for our fleet retirements. Due to the inherent uncertainties of the current operating environment, we will continue to evaluate our current fleet and may decide to permanently retire additional aircraft. In addition, we have placed a number of Boeing 737-800 and certain regional aircraft into temporary storage.  Cost Reductions We moved quickly  to better align our costs with our  reduced schedule.  In aggregate, we estimate  that we  reduced our 2020 operating and capital  expenditures  by more  than  $17  billion.  These  savings  were  achieved  primarily  through  capacity  reductions.  In  addition,  we  implemented  a  series  of actions, including the accelerated fleet retirements discussed above as well as reductions in maintenance expense and $700 million in non-aircraft capital expenditures through less fleet modification work, the elimination of ground service equipment purchases and pausing non-critical facility investments and information technology projects. We also suspended all non-essential hiring, paused non-contractual pay rate increases, reduced executive and board of director compensation,  implemented voluntary  leave and early  retirement programs and decreased our management and support staff  team,  including officers, by approximately 30%. In total, more than 20,000 team members have opted for an early retirement or long-term partially paid leave. Additionally, we have made reductions in marketing, contractor, event and training expenses as well as consolidated space at airport facilities.  65    Table of Contents  Due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, we involuntarily furloughed certain team members starting October 1, 2020, and subsequently recalled the team members covered by the PSP2 financial assistance effective December 1, 2020 (see Note 18 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A for further information).  On February 5, 2021, we informed approximately 13,000 U.S.-based team members of the possibility of a workforce reduction at their work location. We expect that any workforce reductions will take effect on or after April 1, 2021. In connection with this notification, we announced the reopening of the voluntary early out and long-term leave of absence programs for team members of certain represented workgroups. Eligible team members must opt in by February 26, 2021 for the early out program and March 12, 2021 for the voluntary leave program.  Liquidity As of December 31, 2020, we had $14.3 billion in total available liquidity, consisting of $6.9 billion in unrestricted cash and short-term investments, $7.0  billion in an undrawn term loan facility under the CARES Act and a total of $446 million in undrawn short-term revolving and other facilities.  During 2020, we completed the following financing transactions (see Note 5 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A for further information):  • refinanced the $1.2 billion 2014 Term Loan Facility at a lower interest rate and extended the maturity from 2021 to 2027;  • issued $500 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.75% unsecured senior notes due 2025;  • raised $1.0 billion from the senior secured delayed draw term loan credit facility (Delayed Draw Term Loan Credit Facility);  • borrowed $750 million under the 2013 Revolving Facility, $1.6 billion under the 2014 Revolving Facility and $450 million under the April 2016 Revolving Facility;  • issued $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of 6.50% convertible senior notes due 2025;  • issued 85.2 million shares of AAG common stock at a price of $13.50 per share and 44.3 million shares of AAG common stock at a price of $12.975 per share pursuant to two underwritten public offerings of common stock for aggregate net proceeds of $1.7 billion;  • issued $2.5 billion  in aggregate principal amount of 11.75% senior secured notes due 2025 and used the proceeds  thereof,  in part,  to repay the $1.0 billion Delayed Draw Term Loan Credit Facility that we borrowed in March 2020;  • issued  approximately  $360 million  in  special  facility  revenue  bonds,  of which  $47 million was  used  to  fund  the  redemption  of  certain outstanding bonds;  • entered into a $7.5 billion secured term loan facility with the U.S. Department of Treasury (Treasury) (the Treasury Loan Agreement), of which we borrowed $550 million;  • issued $1.2 billion in aggregate principal amount of two series of 10.75% senior secured notes due 2026 secured by various collateral;  • issued 68.6 million shares of AAG common stock at an average price of $12.87 per share pursuant to an at-the-market offering for net proceeds of $869 million (see Note 18 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A for further information);  • raised  $665 million  principally  from  aircraft  sale-leaseback  transactions  as  well  as  $351 million  from  asset  sales  primarily  related  to previously parked aircraft; and  • received  approximately  $600  million  of  proceeds  from  enhanced  equipment  trust  certificates  (EETCs)  and  other  aircraft  and  flight equipment financings, of which $17 million was used to repay existing indebtedness.  66    Table of Contents  In addition to the foregoing financings, we received an aggregate of $6.0 billion  in financial assistance through PSP1 established under the CARES Act, all of which was received by the end of September 2020. In connection with our receipt of this financial assistance, AAG issued a promissory note (the PSP1 Promissory Note)  to Treasury  for $1.8 billion  in aggregate principal amount and warrants  to purchase up  to an aggregate of approximately 14.1 million shares (the PSP1 Warrant Shares) of AAG common stock. See Note 1(b) to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A for further discussion on PSP1.  In January 2021, we received $1.5 billion (of an expected total of at least $3.0 billion) in financial assistance through PSP2 established under the PSP Extension Law. In connection with our receipt of this financial assistance, AAG issued a promissory note (the PSP2 Promissory Note) to Treasury for an initial principal sum of approximately $433 million and warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of approximately 2.8 million shares (the PSP2 Warrant Shares) of AAG common stock. See Note 18 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A for further discussion on PSP2.  Also, we are permitted  to,  and have, deferred payment of  the employer portion of Social Security  taxes  through  the end of 2020  (with 50% of  the deferred amount due December 31, 2021 and the remaining 50% due December 31, 2022). This deferral provided approximately $350 million in additional liquidity during 2020. Additionally, we have suspended our capital return program, including share repurchases and the payment of future dividends for at least the period that the restrictions imposed by the CARES Act and the PSP Extension Law are applicable.  We continue to evaluate future financing opportunities and work with third-party appraisers on valuations of our remaining unencumbered assets.  A significant portion of our debt financing agreements contain covenants requiring us to maintain an aggregate of at  least $2.0 billion of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and amounts available to be drawn under revolving credit facilities and/or contain loan to value, collateral coverage and/or debt service coverage ratio covenants.  Given the above actions and our current assumptions about the future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on travel demand, which could be materially different due to the inherent uncertainties of the current operating environment, we expect to meet our cash obligations as well as remain in compliance with  the  debt  covenants  in  our  existing  financing  agreements  for  the  next  12 months  based  on  our  current  level  of  unrestricted  cash  and  short-term investments, our anticipated access to liquidity (including via proceeds from financings and funds from government assistance obtained pursuant to the CARES Act and the PSP Extension Law) and projected cash flows from operations.  See Note 5 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A for additional information on our debt obligations.  67    Table of Contents  AAG’s 2020 Results The selected financial data presented below is derived from AAG’s audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8A of this report  and should be read in conjunction with those financial statements and the related notes thereto.

Selected  Consolidated  Financial  Data  –  “Reconciliation  of  GAAP  to  Non-GAAP  Financial  Measures”   and  Note  2  to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A for details on the components of net special items. Not meaningful or greater than 100% change.  Pre-Tax Income (Loss) and Net Income (Loss) Pre-tax loss and net loss were $11.5 billion and $8.9 billion, respectively, in 2020. This compares to 2019 pre-tax income and net income of $2.3 billion  and $1.7 billion, respectively. The year-over-year decrease in our pre-tax income was principally driven by lower revenues as a result of a severe decline in passenger demand and government travel restrictions related to the outbreak and spread of COVID-19. This decline in revenues was offset in part by a decrease in expenses due to our reduced schedule and cost reduction actions described above. Additionally, we recognized $796 million of net special credits  in  2020  driven  principally  by  the  PSP1  financial  assistance  (the  PSP1  Financial Assistance),  offset  in  part  by  severance  expenses  and  fleet impairment charges. See Notes 1 and 2  to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements  in Part  II,  Item 8A  for  further  information on  the PSP1 Financial Assistance and net special items, respectively.  Excluding the effects of pre-tax net special items, pre-tax loss was $12.2 billion in 2020 and pre-tax income was $2.9 billion in 2019. The year-over- year decrease  in our pre-tax  income excluding pre-tax net special  items was principally driven by  lower  revenues and decreased expenses due  to our reduced schedule and cost reduction actions as described above.  Revenue In 2020, we reported total operating revenues of $17.3 billion, a decrease of $28.4 billion, or 62.1%, as compared to 2019. Passenger revenue was  $14.5 billion, a decrease of $27.5 billion, or 65.4%, as compared to 2019. The decrease in passenger revenue in 2020 was due to a severe decline  in passenger demand and government  travel  restrictions  related  to  the COVID-19 pandemic,  resulting  in a 61.9% decrease  in  revenue passenger miles (RPMs) and a 20.5 point decrease in passenger load factor.  (2)  (1)  (1)  (2)  68    Table of Contents  In 2020, cargo revenue was $769 million, a decrease of $94 million, or 10.8%, as compared to 2019, primarily due to a 44.4% decrease in cargo ton miles reflecting declines in freight volumes, principally as a result of international schedule reductions, which was offset in part by a 60.5% increase in yield as a result of rate increases.  Other operating revenue decreased $845 million, or 29.2%, in 2020 as compared to 2019, driven primarily by lower revenue associated with our loyalty program and airport clubs.  Our total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM) was 12.11 cents in 2020, a 24.6% decrease as compared to 16.05 cents in 2019.  Fuel Our mainline and  regional  fuel expense  totaled $3.4 billion  in 2020, which was $6.0 billion, or 63.8%,  lower compared  to 2019. This decrease was  primarily driven by a 49.4% decrease in gallons of fuel consumed as a result of lower capacity and a 28.5% decrease in the average price per gallon of aircraft fuel including related taxes to $1.48 in 2020 from $2.07 in 2019.  As of December 31, 2020, we did not have any fuel hedging contracts outstanding to hedge our fuel consumption. Our current policy is not to enter into transactions to hedge our fuel consumption, although we review that policy from time to time based on market conditions and other factors. We do not currently  view  the market  opportunities  to  hedge  fuel  prices  as  attractive  because,  among  other  things,  our  future  fuel  needs  remain  unclear  due  to uncertainties  regarding air  travel  demand and any hedging would potentially  require  significant  capital  or  collateral  to  be placed at  risk. As  such,  and assuming we do not enter into any future transactions to hedge our fuel consumption, we will continue to be fully exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices.  Other Costs We remain committed  to actively managing our cost structure, which we believe  is necessary  in an  industry whose economic prospects are heavily  dependent upon two variables we cannot control: general economic conditions and the price of fuel. In particular, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a very rapid deterioration in general economic conditions, particularly as applicable to the travel industry.  Our 2020 total cost per available seat mile (CASM) was 19.39 cents, an increase of 29.4%, from 14.98 cents in 2019. Lower than planned capacity in 2020 due to decreased passenger demand and government travel restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic drove the increase in our CASM, offset in part by the PSP1 Financial Assistance recognized in 2020.  Our 2020 CASM excluding net special  items and fuel was 17.69 cents, an increase of 54.4%, from 11.46 cents in 2019. The increase was primarily driven by lower capacity in 2020 as described above.  For a reconciliation of total operating  CASM to total operating CASM excluding net special items and fuel, see Part II, Item 6. Selected Consolidated Financial Data – “Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”  69    Table of Contents  AAG’s Results of Operations As discussed above, our results of operations for 2020 were significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Depreciation and amortization increased $58 million, or 3.0%, in 2020 from 2019 due in part to accelerated depreciation for certain aircraft and related equipment expected to be retired earlier than planned. Depreciation associated with facility improvements also contributed to the increase.  71    Table of Contents  Operating Special Items, Net    Year Ended December 31,          2020 2019   (In millions) PSP1 Financial Assistance  $ (3,710) $ —  Fleet impairment  1,484  213  Severance expenses  1,408  11  Labor contract expenses  228  —  Mark-to-market adjustments on bankruptcy obligations, net  (49) (11) Fleet restructuring expenses  —  271  Merger integration expenses  —  191  Litigation reserve adjustments —  (53) Other operating special items, net (18) 13   Mainline operating special items, net (657) 635   PSP1 Financial Assistance  (444) —  Fleet impairment  117  —  Severance expenses  18  —  Other operating special items, net —  6   Regional operating special items, net (309) 6  Operating special items, net $ (966) $ 641   PSP1 Financial Assistance represents recognition of financial assistance received from Treasury pursuant to the PSP1 Agreement. See Note 1(b) to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A for further information.  The 2020 fleet impairment resulted from our decision to retire certain aircraft earlier than planned driven by the severe decline in air travel due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Aircraft  retired  include Airbus A330-200, Boeing 757, Boeing 767, Airbus A330-300, Embraer 190, certain Embraer 140 and Bombardier CRJ200 aircraft. This  included a $1.5 billion non-cash write-down of mainline and regional aircraft and spare parts and $109 million  in cash charges primarily for impairment of right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease return costs. See Note 1(g) to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A for further information related to these charges.  The 2019 fleet impairment principally included a non-cash write-down of aircraft related to the retirement of our Embraer 190 fleet.  The 2020 severance expenses  included salary and medical costs primarily associated with certain  team members who opted  in  to voluntary early retirement programs offered as a result of reductions to our operation due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Cash payments related to these charges for the year ended December 31, 2020 were approximately $365 million.  The 2019 severance expenses primarily included costs associated with reductions of management and support staff team members.  Labor contract expenses primarily related to one-time charges resulting from the ratification of a new contract with the TWU-IAM Association for our maintenance and fleet service team members, including signing bonuses and adjustments to vacation accruals resulting from pay rate increases.  Bankruptcy obligations that will be settled in shares of AAG common stock are marked-to-market based on AAG’s stock price.

Interest  expense,  net increased in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to the issuance of debt and lower capitalized interest offset  in part by lower interest expense on our variable-rate debt.  In  2020,  other  nonoperating  income,  net  included  $329 million  of  non-service  related  pension  and  other  postretirement  benefit  plan  income.  This income was offset in part by $170 million of net special charges principally for mark-to-market unrealized losses associated with our equity investment in China Southern Airlines  and  certain  treasury  rate  lock  derivative  instruments  and $24 million  of  net  foreign  currency  losses,  primarily  associated with losses from Latin American currencies.  In 2019, other nonoperating income, net principally included $183 million of non-service related pension and other postretirement benefit plan income. This income was offset in part by $32 million of net foreign currency losses, primarily associated with losses from Latin American currencies.  The increase in non-service related pension and other postretirement benefit plan income in 2020 as compared to 2019 is principally due to an increase in the expected return on pension plan assets.  Income Taxes In 2020, we  recorded an  income  tax benefit of $2.6 billion at an effective  rate of approximately 22%. Substantially all of our  income or  loss before  income taxes is attributable to the United States. At December 31, 2020, we had approximately $16.5 billion of federal NOLs available to reduce future federal  taxable  income,  of which  $8.5  billion will  expire  beginning  in  2023  if  unused and $8.0  billion  can  be  carried  forward  indefinitely. We also  had approximately $5.0 billion of NOL Carryforwards  to  reduce  future state  taxable  income at December 31, 2020, which will expire  in  taxable years 2020 through 2040 if unused.  In 2019, we recorded an income tax provision of $570 million at an effective rate of approximately 25%, which was substantially non-cash.  See Note 7 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A for additional information on income taxes.  American’s Results of Operations As discussed above, American’s results of operations for 2020 were significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.

The increase in non-service related pension and other postretirement benefit plan income in 2020 as compared to 2019 is principally due to an increase in the expected return on pension plan assets.  Income Taxes American is a member of AAG’s consolidated federal and certain state income tax returns.  In 2020, American recorded an income tax benefit of $2.5 billion at an effective rate of approximately 22%. Substantially all of American’s income or loss before income taxes is attributable to the United States. At December 31, 2020, American had approximately $16.5 billion of federal NOLs available to reduce  future  federal  taxable  income, of which $8.9 billion will  expire beginning  in 2023  if  unused and $7.6 billion  can be  carried  forward  indefinitely. American also had approximately $5.0 billion of NOL Carryforwards  to  reduce  future state  taxable  income at December 31, 2020, which will expire  in taxable years 2020 through 2040 if unused.  In 2019, American recorded an income tax provision of $633 million at an effective rate of approximately 24%, which was substantially non-cash.  See Note 5 to American’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B for additional information on income taxes.  76    Table of Contents  Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity  At December 31, 2020, AAG had $14.3 billion in total available liquidity and $609 million in restricted cash and short-term investments. Additional detail regarding our available liquidity is provided in the table below (in millions):    AAG American   December 31, December 31,   2020 2019 2020 2019 Cash $ 245  $ 280  $ 231  $ 267  Short-term investments 6,619  3,546  6,617  3,543  Undrawn facilities 7,396  3,243  7,396  3,243   Total available liquidity $ 14,260  $ 7,069  $ 14,244  $ 7,053   Given the actions we have taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and our assumptions about its future impact on travel demand, which could be materially different due to the current inherent uncertainties of the current operating environment, we expect to meet our cash obligations as well as remain in compliance with the debt covenants in our existing financing agreements for the next 12 months based on our current level of unrestricted cash and short-term investments, our anticipated access to  liquidity (including via proceeds from financings and funds from government assistance obtained pursuant to the CARES Act and the PSP Extension Law) and projected cash flows from operations.  Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends In 2020, we repurchased 6.4 million shares of AAG common stock for $145 million at a weighted average cost per share of $22.77, all of which were  purchased in the first quarter of 2020.  In January 2020, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.10 per share for stockholders of record as of February 5, 2020 and paid on February 19, 2020, totaling $43 million.  We have suspended our capital  return program,  including share repurchases and the payment of  future dividends.  In connection with our receipt of financial assistance under PSP1 and PSP2, we agreed not to repurchase shares of or make dividend payments in respect of AAG common stock through at  least March 31, 2022. In addition, we have entered into the Treasury Loan Agreement, and, as a result, we are further prohibited from repurchasing shares of AAG common stock and paying dividends on AAG common stock through the date that is one year after the secured loan provided under the Treasury Loan Agreement is fully repaid.  Certain Covenants Certain of our debt financing agreements (including our secured notes, term loans, revolving credit facilities and spare engine EETCs) contain loan to  value  (LTV)  or  collateral  coverage  ratio  covenants  and  require  us  to  appraise  the  related  collateral  annually  or  semiannually.  Pursuant  to  such agreements,  if  the  LTV  or  collateral  coverage  ratio  exceeds  a  specified  threshold  or  if  the  value  of  the  appraised  collateral  fails  to meet  a  specified threshold,  as  the  case may  be,  we  are  required,  as  applicable,  to  pledge  additional  qualifying  collateral  (which  in  some  cases may  include  cash  or investment securities), or pay down such financing, in whole or in part, or the interest rate for the financing under such agreements will be increased. As of the most recent applicable measurement dates, we were in compliance with each of the foregoing collateral coverage tests. Additionally, a significant portion of our debt financing agreements contain covenants requiring us to maintain an aggregate of at  least $2.0 billion of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and amounts available  to be drawn under  revolving credit  facilities, and our Treasury Term Loan Facility contains a debt service coverage ratio, pursuant  to which  failure  to comply with a certain  threshold may  result  in mandatory prepayment of  the Treasury Term Loan Facility. For  further information  regarding  our  debt  covenants,  see  Note  5  to  AAG’s  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  in  Part  II,  Item  8A  and  Note  3  to  American’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B.  77    Table of Contents  Sources and Uses of Cash For  a  comparison of  the  2019 and 2018  reporting  periods,  see Part  II,  Item 7. Management’s Discussion  and Analysis  of  Financial Condition  and  Results of Operations – “Sources and Uses of Cash”  of our 2019 Form 10-K.  AAG Operating Activities Our net cash used in operating activities was $6.5 billion in 2020 as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $3.8 billion in 2019. The  $10.4 billion year-over-year decrease in operating cash flows was primarily due to a net  loss  in 2020. The net  loss was driven by  lower revenues as a result of a severe decline in passenger demand and government travel restrictions related to the outbreak and spread of COVID-19, offset  in part by a decrease in expenses due to our reduced schedule and cost reduction actions. Additionally, we received cash proceeds of $4.2 billion in 2020 associated with the PSP1 Financial Assistance. In 2020, we also recorded a $1.4 billion special charge for salary and medical costs primarily associated with certain team members who opted in to voluntary early retirement programs. Approximately $365 million of this charge has been paid to team members in 2020. We expect cash payments under these programs of approximately $600 million in 2021 with the remaining payments in 2022 and beyond.  Investing Activities Our net cash used in investing activities was $4.3 billion and $2.2 billion in 2020 and 2019, respectively.  Our principal investing activities in 2020 included $3.1 billion in net purchases of short-term investments, expenditures of $2.0 billion for property and equipment,  including  16  Airbus  A321neo  aircraft,  eight  Embraer  175  aircraft,  three  Bombardier  CRJ900  aircraft  and  the  harmonization  of  interior configurations across  the mainline  fleet as well as a $308 million  increase  in  restricted short-term  investments primarily  related  to cash proceeds  from special  facility  revenue bonds. These cash outflows were offset  in part by $665 million of proceeds primarily  from aircraft sale-leaseback  transactions, $351 million of proceeds from the sale of property and equipment and $90 million of proceeds from a vendor.  Our  principal  investing  activities  in  2019  included  expenditures  of  $4.3  billion  for  property  and  equipment,  including  21  Embraer  175  aircraft,  12 Bombardier CRJ900 aircraft, 12 Airbus A321neo aircraft, four Boeing 737 MAX Family aircraft and two Boeing 787 Family aircraft. These cash outflows were offset in part by $960 million in net sales of short-term investments, $850 million of proceeds primarily from aircraft sale-leaseback transactions and $250 million in proceeds from a vendor.  Financing Activities Our net cash provided by financing activities was $11.0 billion in 2020 as compared to net cash used in financing activities of $1.6 billion in 2019.  Our principal financing activities in 2020 included $11.8 billion in proceeds from the issuance of debt and $3.0 billion in proceeds from the issuance of equity.  These  proceeds  principally  include  $2.8  billion  borrowed  under  the  2014  Revolving  Facility,  the  2013  Revolving  Facility  and  the  April  2016 Revolving Facility, $2.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of 11.75% senior secured notes, $1.8 billion in aggregate principal amount under the PSP1 Promissory Note, $1.2 billion  in aggregate principal amount of  two series of 10.75% senior secured notes due 2026, $1.0 billion  in aggregate principal amount  of AAG’s  6.50% convertible  senior  notes,  $1.0  billion  under  the Delayed Draw Term Loan Credit  Facility,  $600 million  in  connection with  the issuance of equipment notes related to EETCs and the financing of certain aircraft, $550 million under the Treasury Term Loan Facility, $500 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.75% unsecured senior notes due 2025 and the $360 million issuance of special  facility revenue bonds as well as $1.7 billion of net proceeds from two underwritten public offerings of common stock and $869 million of net proceeds from an at-the-market offering of common stock. These cash inflows were offset  in part by $3.5 billion  in debt repayments, consisting of approximately $2.5 billion  in scheduled debt repayments, including repayment of $500 million of 4.625% senior notes, and the prepayment of the $1.0 billion Delayed Draw Term Loan Credit Facility, as well as $216 million in share repurchases and dividend payments (which occurred in the first quarter of 2020).  78    Table of Contents  Our  principal  financing  activities  in  2019  included  $4.2  billion  in  debt  repayments,  consisting  of  $2.9  billion  in  scheduled  debt  repayments  and  the prepayment of $1.3 billion of secured loans. We also had $1.1 billion in share repurchases and $178 million in dividend payments. These cash outflows were offset  in part by $4.0 billion  in proceeds  from  the  issuance of debt, consisting of $3.2 billion  in connection with  the  issuance of equipment notes related to EETCs and the financing of certain aircraft and other flight equipment, as well as the issuance of $750 million aggregate principal amount of 5.000% senior notes.  American Operating Activities American’s net cash used  in operating activities was $1.4 billion  in 2020 as compared  to net cash provided by operating activities of $2.4 billion  in  2019. The  $3.9  billion  year-over-year  decrease  in  operating  cash  flows was  primarily  due  to  a  net  loss  in  2020,  offset  in  part  by  intercompany  cash receipts  from AAG\\'s  financing  transactions.  The  net  loss  was  driven  by  lower  revenues  as  a  result  of  a  severe  decline  in  passenger  demand  and government  travel  restrictions  related  to  the  outbreak  and  spread  of COVID-19,  offset  in  part  by  a  decrease  in  expenses  due  to American\\'s  reduced schedule and cost reduction actions. Additionally, American received cash proceeds of $3.7 billion in 2020 associated with the PSP1 Financial Assistance. In 2020, American also recorded a $1.4 billion special charge for salary and medical costs primarily associated with certain team members who opted in to voluntary early retirement programs. Approximately $365 million of this charge has been paid to team members in 2020. American expects cash payments under these programs of approximately $600 million in 2021 with the remaining payments in 2022 and beyond.  Investing Activities American’s net cash used in investing activities was $4.3 billion and $2.1 billion in 2020 and 2019, respectively.  American’s  principal  investing  activities  in  2020  included  $3.1  billion  in  net  purchases  of  short-term  investments,  expenditures  of  $1.9  billion  for property and equipment,  including 16 Airbus A321neo aircraft, eight Embraer 175 aircraft,  three Bombardier CRJ900 aircraft and  the harmonization of interior configurations across the mainline fleet as well as a $308 million increase in restricted short-term investments primarily related to cash proceeds from special facility revenue bonds. These cash outflows were offset in part by $665 million of proceeds primarily from aircraft sale-leaseback transactions, $351 million of proceeds from the sale of property and equipment and $90 million of proceeds from a vendor.  American’s principal investing activities in 2019 included expenditures of $4.2 billion for property and equipment, including 21 Embraer 175 aircraft, 12 Bombardier CRJ900 aircraft, 12 Airbus A321neo aircraft, four Boeing 737 MAX Family aircraft and two Boeing 787 Family aircraft. These cash outflows were offset in part by $960 million in net sales of short-term investments, $850 million of proceeds primarily from aircraft sale-leaseback transactions and $250 million in proceeds from a vendor.  Financing Activities American’s net cash provided by  financing activities was $5.8 billion  in 2020 as compared  to net cash used  in  financing activities of $282 million  in  2019.  American’s principal financing activities in 2020 included $9.0 billion in proceeds from the issuance of debt, including $2.8 billion borrowed under the 2014 Revolving Facility,  the 2013 Revolving Facility and  the April 2016 Revolving Facility, $2.5 billion  in aggregate principal amount of 11.75% senior secured notes, $1.2 billion  in aggregate principal amount of  two series of 10.75% senior secured notes due 2026, $1.0 billion under the Delayed Draw Term Loan Credit Facility, $600 million in connection with the issuance of equipment notes related to EETCs and the financing of certain aircraft, $550 million under the Treasury Term Loan Facility and the $360 million issuance of special facility revenue bonds. These cash inflows were offset in part by $3.0 billion  in debt  repayments, consisting of approximately $2.0 billion  in scheduled debt  repayments and  the prepayment of  the $1.0 billion Delayed Draw Term Loan Credit Facility.  American’s principal financing activities in 2019 included $3.4 billion in debt repayments, consisting of $2.1 billion in scheduled debt repayments and the  prepayment  of  $1.3  billion  of  secured  loans.  These  cash  outflows  were  offset  in  part  by  $3.2  billion  in  proceeds  from  the  issuance  of  debt  for equipment notes related to EETCs and the financing of certain aircraft and other flight equipment.  79    Table of Contents  Commitments For  further  information regarding our commitments, see  the Notes  to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements  in Part  II,  Item 8A and  the Notes  to  American’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B at the referenced footnotes below.    AAG    American Long-term debt and debt covenants Note 5    Note 3 Leases Note 6 Note 4 Employee benefit plans Note 10    Note 8 Commitments, contingencies and guarantees Note 12    Note 10  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements An off-balance sheet arrangement  is any  transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement  involving an unconsolidated entity under which a  company has (1) made guarantees, (2) a retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets, (3) an obligation under derivative instruments classified as equity or (4) any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to us, or that engages in leasing, hedging or research and development arrangements with us.  We have no off-balance sheet arrangements of the types described in the first three categories above that we believe may have a material current or future effect on financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.  Pass-Through Trusts American currently operates 350 owned aircraft and 24  leased aircraft, and owns 62 spare aircraft engines, which  in each case were  financed with  EETCs  issued  by  pass-through  trusts. These  trusts  are  off-balance  sheet  entities,  the  primary  purpose  of which  is  to  finance  the  acquisition  of  flight equipment or to permit  issuance of debt backed by existing flight equipment. In the case of aircraft EETCs, rather than finance each aircraft separately when such aircraft  is purchased, delivered or  refinanced,  these  trusts allow American  to raise  the  financing  for a number of aircraft at one  time and,  if applicable, place such funds in escrow pending a future purchase, delivery or refinancing of the relevant aircraft. Similarly, in the case of the spare engine EETCs, the trusts allow American to use its existing pool of spare engines to raise financing under a single facility. The trusts have also been structured to provide for certain credit enhancements, such as liquidity facilities to cover certain interest payments, that reduce the risks to the purchasers of the trust certificates and, as a result, reduce the cost of aircraft financing to American.  Each trust covers a set number of aircraft or spare engines scheduled to be delivered, financed or refinanced upon the issuance of the EETC or within a specific period of time thereafter. At the time of each covered aircraft or spare engine financing, the relevant trust used the proceeds of the issuance of the EETC (which may have been available at the time of issuance thereof or held in escrow until financing of the applicable aircraft following its delivery) to purchase  equipment  notes  relating  to  the  financed  aircraft  or  engines. The  equipment  notes  are  issued,  at American’s  election,  in  connection with  a mortgage financing of the aircraft or spare engines or, in certain cases, by a separate owner trust in connection with a leveraged lease financing of the aircraft. In the case of a leveraged lease financing, the owner trust then leases the aircraft to American. In both cases, the equipment notes are secured by a security  interest  in  the aircraft or engines, as applicable. The pass-through trust certificates are not direct obligations of, nor are  they guaranteed by, AAG or American. However, in the case of mortgage financings, the equipment notes issued to the trusts are direct obligations of American and, in certain instances, have been guaranteed by AAG. As of December 31, 2020, $11.0 billion associated with these mortgage financings is reflected as debt in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.  With  respect  to  leveraged  leases, American evaluated whether  the  leases had characteristics of  a  variable  interest entity. American concluded  the leasing  entities  met  the  criteria  for  variable  interest  entities;  however,  American  concluded  it  is  not  the  primary  beneficiary  under  these  leasing arrangements and accounts for the majority of its EETC leveraged lease financings as operating leases. American’s total future payments to the trusts of each of the relevant EETCs under these leveraged lease financings are $78 million as of December 31, 2020, which are reflected in the operating lease obligations in Note 6 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A and Note 4 to American’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B.  80    Table of Contents  Letters of Credit and Other We provide  financial  assurance,  such  as  letters  of  credit,  surety  bonds  or  restricted  cash  and  investments,  primarily  to  support  projected workers’  compensation obligations and airport commitments. As of December 31, 2020, we had $476 million of letters of credit and surety bonds securing various obligations, of which $110 million is collateralized with our restricted cash. The letters of credit and surety bonds that are subject to expiration will expire on various dates through 2024.  Contractual Obligations The following table provides details of our future cash contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020 (in millions). Except to the extent set forth in the  applicable accompanying footnotes, the table does not include commitments that are contingent on events or other factors that are uncertain or unknown at this time.    Payments Due by Period    2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 and Thereafter Total  American  Long-term debt: Principal amount  (See Note 3) $ 2,749  $ 1,672  $ 4,162  $ 4,401  $ 6,421  $ 9,326  $ 28,731  Interest obligations  1,161  1,065  997  900  767  800  5,690   Finance lease obligations (See Note 4) 131  136  114  120  85  89  675  Aircraft and engine purchase commitments   (See Note 10(a)) 527  1,661  1,592  2,377  3,381  1,742  11,280   Operating lease commitments (See Note 4) 2,036  1,932  1,743  1,352  975  4,194  12,232  Regional capacity purchase agreements   (See Note 10(b)) 1,120  1,666  1,685  1,663  1,511  3,646  11,291  Minimum pension obligations  (See Note 8) 694  553  552  580  264  31  2,674  Retiree medical and other postretirement benefits (See Note 8) 75  71  68  66  63  269  612   Other purchase obligations  (See Note 10(a)) 2,278  1,282  1,184  242  163  1,047  6,196  Total American Contractual Obligations $ 10,771  $ 10,038  $ 12,097  $ 11,701  $ 13,630  $ 21,144  $ 79,381   AAG Parent and Other AAG Subsidiaries  Long-term debt: Principal amount  (See Note 5) $ 2  $ 752  $ 2  $ 2  $ 1,503  $ 1,778  $ 4,039  Interest obligations  142  122  103  102  109  274  852   Operating lease commitments (See Note 6) 14  13  11  8  4  16  66  Minimum pension obligations  (See Note 10) 3  3  3  3  3  5  20   Total AAG Contractual Obligations $ 10,932  $ 10,928  $ 12,216  $ 11,816  $ 15,249  $ 23,217  $ 84,358   For  additional  information,  see  the Notes  to AAG’s  and American’s Consolidated  Financial  Statements  in  Part  II,  Items  8A  and  8B,  respectively, referenced in the table above.  Amounts represent contractual amounts due. Excludes $321 million and $428 million of unamortized debt discount, premium and issuance costs as of December 31, 2020 for American and AAG Parent, respectively.  For variable-rate debt, future interest obligations are estimated using the current forward rates at December 31, 2020.  Includes $11.0 billion of future principal payments and $1.9 billion of future interest payments as of December 31, 2020, related to EETCs associated with mortgage financings of certain aircraft and spare engines.  See Part  I,  Item 2. Properties –  “Aircraft and Engine Purchase Commitments”  for additional  information about the firm commitment aircraft delivery schedule,  in particular  the  footnotes  to  the  table  thereunder as  to potential changes  to such delivery schedule. Due  to uncertainty surrounding  the timing of delivery of certain aircraft, the amounts in the  (a)  (b), (d)   (c), (d)  (e)     (f)  (g)   (h)   (a)  (b)   (c)  (g)   (a)  (b)  (c)  (d)  (e)  81    Table of Contents  table represent our current best estimate; however, the actual delivery schedule may differ from the table above, potentially materially. Additionally, the  amounts  in  the  table  exclude  19  Boeing  787-8  aircraft  to  be  delivered  in  2021  for  which  we  have  obtained  committed  lease  financing.  This financing is reflected in the operating lease commitments line above.  Represents minimum payments under capacity purchase agreements with  third-party  regional carriers. These commitments are estimates of costs based  on  assumed  minimum  levels  of  flying  under  the  capacity  purchase  agreements  and  our  actual  payments  could  differ  materially.  Rental payments  under  operating  leases  for  certain  aircraft  flown  under  these  capacity  purchase  agreements  are  reflected  in  the  operating  lease commitments line above.  Includes minimum pension contributions based on actuarially determined estimates as of December 31, 2020 and is based on estimated payments through 2030. Pursuant to the CARES Act passed in March 2020, minimum required pension contributions to be made in the calendar year 2020 can be deferred to January 1, 2021, with interest accruing from the original due date to the new payment date. In January 2021, we made $241 million of required pension contributions, including the $130 million minimum contributions required for 2020.  Includes purchase commitments for aircraft fuel, flight equipment maintenance, construction projects and information technology support.  Capital Raising Activity and Other Possible Actions In  light of  the cash needs  imposed by  the current operating  losses due  to  reduced demand  in  response  to  the COVID-19 pandemic as well as our  significant  financial  commitments  related  to,  among other  things,  new  flight  equipment,  the  servicing and amortization of  existing  debt  and equipment leasing  arrangements,  and  pension  funding  obligations, we  and  our  subsidiaries will  regularly  consider,  and  enter  into  negotiations  related  to,  capital raising and  liability management  activity, which may  include  the entry  into  leasing  transactions and  future  issuances of,  and  transactions  designed  to manage the timing and amount of, secured or unsecured debt obligations or additional equity securities  in public or private offerings or otherwise. The cash available from operations (if any) and these sources, however, may not be sufficient to cover our cash obligations because economic factors may reduce the amount of cash generated by operations or increase costs. For instance, an economic downturn or general global instability caused by military actions, terrorism, disease outbreaks (in particular the ongoing global outbreak of COVID-19), natural disasters or other causes could reduce the demand for air travel, which would reduce the amount of cash generated by operations. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors – \"The outbreak and global spread of COVID-19 has resulted in a severe decline in demand for air travel which has adversely impacted our business, operating results, financial condition and liquidity. The duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, and similar public health threats that we may face in the future, could result in additional adverse  effects  on  our  business,  operating  results,  financial  condition  and  liquidity\" for  additional  discussion. An  increase  in  costs,  either  due  to  an increase  in  borrowing  costs  caused  by  a  reduction  in  credit  ratings  or  a  general  increase  in  interest  rates,  or  due  to  an  increase  in  the  cost  of  fuel, maintenance, aircraft, aircraft engines or parts, could decrease the amount of cash available to cover cash contractual obligations. Moreover, certain of our financing arrangements contain significant minimum cash balance or similar liquidity requirements. As a result, we cannot use all of our available cash to fund operations, capital expenditures and cash obligations without violating these requirements. See Note 5 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A and Note 3 to American’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B for information regarding our financing arrangements.  In  the  past, we  have  from  time  to  time  refinanced,  redeemed  or  repurchased  our  debt  and  taken  other  steps  to  reduce  or  otherwise manage  the aggregate  amount  and  cost  of  our  debt,  lease  and  other  obligations  or  otherwise  improve  our  balance  sheet.  Going  forward,  depending  on  market conditions, our cash position and other considerations, we may continue to take such actions.  OTHER INFORMATION Basis of Presentation  See Note 1  to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements  in Part  II,  Item 8A and Note 1  to American’s Consolidated Financial Statements  in Part  II, Item 8B for information regarding the basis of presentation.  (f)  (g)  (h)  82    Table of Contents  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of  financial statements  in accordance with GAAP requires management  to make certain estimates and assumptions  that affect  the  reported  amounts  of  assets  and  liabilities,  revenues  and  expenses,  and  the  disclosure  of  contingent  assets  and  liabilities  at  the  date  of  the  financial statements. We believe  our  estimates  and assumptions  are  reasonable;  however,  actual  results  could  differ  from  those  estimates. Critical  accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. We have identified the following critical accounting policies that impact the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.  See  the  “Basis  of  Presentation  and  Summary  of  Significant Accounting  Policies ”  included  in  Note  1  to  each  of AAG’s  and American’s Consolidated  Financial  Statements  in  Part  II,  Item  8A  and  8B,  respectively,  for  additional  discussion  of  the  application  of  these  estimates  and  other accounting policies.  Passenger Revenue We  recognize  all  revenues  generated  from  transportation  on American  and  our  regional  flights  operated  under  the  brand  name American  Eagle,  including associated baggage fees and other inflight services, as passenger revenue when transportation is provided. Ticket and other related sales for transportation that has not yet been provided are  initially deferred and recorded as air  traffic  liability on our consolidated balance sheets. The air  traffic liability principally represents tickets sold for future travel on American and partner airlines, as well as estimated future refunds and exchanges of tickets sold for past travel.  The majority of tickets sold are nonrefundable. A small percentage of tickets, some of which are partially used tickets, expire unused. Due to complex pricing structures, refund and exchange policies, and interline agreements with other airlines, certain amounts are recognized in passenger revenue using estimates regarding both the timing of the revenue recognition and the amount of revenue to be recognized. These estimates are generally based on the analysis  of  our  historical  data.  We  have  consistently  applied  this  accounting  method  to  estimate  revenue  from  unused  tickets  at  the  date  of  travel. Estimated future refunds and exchanges included in the air traffic liability are routinely evaluated based on subsequent activity to validate the accuracy of our estimates. Any adjustments resulting from periodic evaluations of the estimated air traffic liability are included in passenger revenue during the period in which the evaluations are completed. While the contract duration of passenger tickets is generally one year, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we extended the contract duration for certain tickets to December 31, 2021, principally those with travel scheduled from March 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020. Additionally, we have eliminated change fees for most domestic and international tickets. As of December 31, 2020, the air traffic liability included approximately $2.6 billion of travel credits related to these unused tickets for travel prior to December 31, 2020. Accordingly, any revenue associated with these tickets will be recognized within the next 12 months. Given this change in contract duration and uncertainty surrounding the future demand for air travel, our estimates of revenue that will be recognized from the air traffic liability for future flown or unused tickets as well as our estimates of refunds may be subject to variability and differ from historical experience.  Various taxes and fees assessed on the sale of tickets to end customers are collected by us as an agent and remitted to taxing authorities. These taxes and fees have been presented on a net basis in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and recorded as a liability until remitted to the appropriate taxing authority. The CARES Act provided for a temporary tax holiday from collecting and remitting certain government ticket taxes for tickets purchased between March 28, 2020 and December 31, 2020.  Loyalty Revenue We currently operate the loyalty program, AAdvantage. This program awards mileage credits to passengers who fly on American, any  oneworld airline  or other partner airlines, or by using the services of other program participants, such as the Citi and Barclaycard US co-branded credit cards, and certain hotels and car rental companies. Mileage credits can be redeemed for travel on American and other participating partner airlines, as well as other non-air travel  awards  such  as  hotels  and  rental  cars.  For mileage  credits  earned  by AAdvantage  loyalty  program members,  we  apply  the  deferred  revenue method.  In  response  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  we  suspended  the  expiration  of  mileage  credits  through  June  30,  2021  and  eliminated  mileage reinstatement fees for canceled award tickets.  Mileage credits earned through travel For mileage credits earned through travel, we apply a relative selling price approach whereby the total amount collected from each passenger ticket  sale is allocated between the air transportation and the mileage credits earned. The portion of each passenger ticket sale attributable to mileage credits earned is initially deferred and then recognized in passenger revenue when mileage credits are redeemed and transportation is provided. The estimated selling price of  83    Table of Contents  mileage credits is determined using an equivalent ticket value approach, which uses historical data, including award redemption patterns by geographic region and class of service, as well as similar  fares as  those used  to settle award redemptions. The estimated selling price of miles  is adjusted  for an estimate of the miles that will not be redeemed using statistical models based on historical redemption patterns to develop an estimate of the likelihood of future  redemption.  Given  the  inherent  uncertainty  of  the  current  operating  environment  due  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  we  will  continue  to  monitor redemption patterns and may adjust our estimates in the future. For the year ended December 31, 2020, a hypothetical 10% increase in the estimated selling price of miles would have decreased revenues by approximately $40 million as a result of additional amounts deferred from passenger ticket sales to be recognized in future periods.  Mileage credits sold to co-branded credit cards and other partners We  sell  mileage  credits  to  participating  airline  partners  and  non-airline  business  partners,  including  our  co-branded  credit  card  partners,  under  contracts with terms extending generally for one to seven years. Consideration received from the sale of mileage credits is variable and payment terms typically  are within 30 days  subsequent  to  the month of mileage sale. Sales of mileage credits  to  non-airline business partners are  comprised of  two components, transportation and marketing. We allocate the consideration received from these sales of mileage credits based on the relative selling price of each product or service delivered.  Our most significant partner agreements are our co-branded credit card agreements with Citi and Barclaycard US. We identified the following revenue elements in these co-branded credit card agreements: the transportation component; and the use of  intellectual property,  including the American brand and  access  to  loyalty  program member  lists, which  is  the  predominant  element  in  the  agreements,  as well  as  advertising  (collectively,  the marketing component). Accordingly, we  recognize  the marketing component  in other  revenue  in  the period of  the mileage sale  following  the sales-based  royalty method.  The transportation component represents the estimated selling price of future travel awards and is determined using the same equivalent ticket value approach described above. The portion of each mileage credit sold attributable  to  transportation  is  initially deferred and  then  recognized  in passenger revenue when mileage credits are redeemed and transportation is provided.  For  the portion of our outstanding mileage credits  that we estimate will  not be  redeemed, we  recognize  the associated value proportionally as  the remaining mileage  credits  are  redeemed. Our  estimates  use  statistical models  based on  historical  redemption  patterns  to  develop  an  estimate  of  the likelihood  of  future  redemption.  For  the  year  ended  December  31,  2020,  a  hypothetical  10%  increase  in  our  estimate  of  miles  not  expected  to  be redeemed would have increased revenues by approximately $35 million.  Long-lived Assets Long-lived assets consist of owned flight and ground equipment, ROU assets and definite-lived intangible assets such as certain domestic airport slots  and gate  leasehold  rights, customer  relationships and marketing agreements.  In addition  to  the original cost,  the  recorded value of our  fixed assets  is impacted by a number of estimates made, including estimated useful lives, salvage values and our determination as to whether aircraft are temporarily or permanently grounded. The majority of our aircraft fleet types are depreciated over 25-30 years. It is possible that the ultimate useful lives of our aircraft will be significantly different than the current estimate due to unforeseen events in the future that impact our fleet plan. Definite-lived intangible assets are originally recorded at their acquired fair values and are subsequently amortized over their estimated useful lives.  Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 360 – Property, Plant and Equipment (ASC 360) requires long-lived assets to be assessed for  impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired. An impairment of a long-lived asset or group of  long-lived assets exists only when the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated directly by the assets are less than the carrying value of the assets. We group  assets  principally  by  fleet-type  when  estimating  future  cash  flows,  which  is  generally  the  lowest  level  for  which  identifiable  cash  flows  exist. Estimates of future cash flows are based on historical results adjusted to reflect management’s best estimate of future market and operating conditions, including our current fleet plan. If such assets are impaired, the impairment charge recognized is the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value. Fair value reflects management’s best estimate including inputs from published pricing guides and bids from third parties as well as contracted sales agreements when applicable.  84    Table of Contents  In 2020, our operations, liquidity and stock price were significantly impacted by decreased passenger demand and government travel restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, we decided to retire certain mainline aircraft earlier than planned, including Airbus A330-200, Boeing 757, Boeing 767, Airbus A330-300 and Embraer 190 aircraft as well as regional aircraft, including certain Embraer 140 and Bombardier CRJ200 aircraft. As a result of these events and circumstances, we performed impairment tests for our long-lived assets in the first three quarters of 2020.  As  a  result  of  the  impairment  tests  performed  on  our  long-lived  assets,  we  determined  the  sum  of  the  estimated  undiscounted  future  cash  flows exceeded the carrying value for our long-lived assets except for the aircraft being retired earlier than planned as discussed above. For those aircraft and certain related spare parts, we recorded impairment charges reflecting the difference between the carrying values of these assets and their fair values of $1.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020. Due to the inherent uncertainties of the current operating environment, we will continue to evaluate our current fleet (including aircraft in temporary storage) and may decide to permanently retire additional aircraft.  Goodwill and Indefinite-lived Assets Goodwill represents the purchase price in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with the merger with  US  Airways  Group.  We  have  one  reporting  unit.  Indefinite-lived  intangible  assets  other  than  goodwill  consist  of  certain  domestic  airport  slots  and international slots and route authorities. ASC 350 – Intangibles – Goodwill and Other (ASC 350) requires goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets to be assessed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the fair values of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets may be lower than their carrying values. Our annual assessment date is October 1.  Goodwill  and  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets  are  assessed  for  impairment  by  initially  performing  a  qualitative  assessment.  Under  the  qualitative approach, we analyze the following factors, among others, to determine if events or circumstances have affected the fair value of goodwill and indefinite- lived  intangible assets:  (1) negative trends  in our market capitalization,  (2) an  increase  in  fuel prices,  (3) declining per mile passenger yields,  (4)  lower passenger demand as a result of a weakened U.S. and global economy and (5) changes to the regulatory environment. If we determine that  it  is more likely than not that our goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets may be impaired, we use a quantitative approach to assess the asset’s fair value and the amount of the impairment, if any.  In addition to our annual impairment assessment, we performed interim impairment tests in 2020 on our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets as  a  result  of  the  events  and  circumstances  previously  discussed  due  to  the  impact  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  on  our  business.  For  goodwill,  we performed a quantitative analysis by using a market approach. Under the market approach, the fair value of the reporting unit was determined based on quoted market prices for equity and the fair value of debt as described in Note 9 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A and Note 7 to American’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B. The fair value exceeded the carrying value of the reporting unit, and our $4.1 billion of goodwill was not impaired.  We performed qualitative impairment tests on our $1.8 billion of indefinite-lived intangible assets and determined there was no material impairment.  As discussed above, due to the inherent uncertainties of the current operating environment, we will continue to evaluate our goodwill and indefinite- lived intangible assets for events or circumstances that indicate that their fair values may be lower than their carrying values.  Pensions and Retiree Medical and Other Postretirement Benefits We recognize  the  funded status  (i.e.,  the difference between  the  fair value of plan assets and  the projected benefit obligations) of our pension and  retiree  medical  and  other  postretirement  benefits  plans  in  the  consolidated  balance  sheets  with  a  corresponding  adjustment  to  accumulated  other comprehensive income (loss).  85    Table of Contents  Our  pension  and  retiree  medical  and  other  postretirement  benefits  costs  and  liabilities  are  calculated  using  various  actuarial  assumptions  and methodologies. We use certain assumptions including, but not limited to, the selection of the: (1) discount rate and (2) expected return on plan assets (as discussed below). These assumptions as of December 31 were:  2020 2019 Pension weighted average discount rate  2.7 % 3.4 % Retiree medical and other postretirement benefits weighted average discount rate  2.4 % 3.3 % Expected rate of return on plan assets  8.0 % 8.0 %  When establishing our discount rate to measure our obligations, we match high quality corporate bonds available in the marketplace whose cash flows approximate our projected benefit disbursements. Lowering the discount rate by 50 basis points as of December 31, 2020 would increase our pension and retiree medical and other postretirement benefits obligations by approximately $1.4 billion and $45 million, respectively, decrease estimated 2021 pension expense by approximately $15 million and increase estimated 2021 retiree medical and other postretirement benefits expense by less than $1 million.  The  expected  rate  of  return  on  plan  assets  is  based  upon  an  evaluation  of  our  historical  trends  and  experience,  taking  into  account  current  and expected market conditions and our target asset allocation of 30% fixed income securities, 24% U.S. stocks, 22% alternative (private)  investments, 16% developed international stocks and 8% emerging market stocks. The expected rate of return on plan assets component of our net periodic benefit cost is calculated based on the fair value of plan assets and our target asset allocation. Lowering the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets by 50 basis points as of December 31, 2020 would increase estimated 2021 pension expense and retiree medical and other postretirement benefits expense by approximately $70 million and $1 million, respectively.  During  2020,  we  reviewed  and  revised  certain  economic  and  demographic  assumptions  including  the  pension  and  retiree  medical  and  other postretirement benefits discount rates and health care cost trend rates. The net effect of changing these assumptions for the pension plans resulted in an increase of $1.7 billion  in  the projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2020. The net effect of changing these assumptions for retiree medical and other postretirement benefits plans resulted in an increase of $80 million in the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at December 31, 2020. We also revised our mortality assumptions to incorporate the new improvement scale issued by the Society of Actuaries. This resulted in a decrease in our pension and retiree medical and other postretirement benefit obligations by $140 million and $1 million, respectively.  See Note 10 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A and Note 8 to American’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B for additional information regarding our employee benefit plans.  Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences  attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded net as noncurrent deferred income taxes.  Our ability to use our NOL Carryforwards depends on the amount of taxable income generated in future periods. We provide a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion, or all of our deferred tax assets, will not be realized. We consider all available positive and negative evidence and make certain assumptions in evaluating the realizability of our deferred tax assets. Many factors are considered that impact our assessment of  future profitability,  including conditions which are beyond our control, such as the health of  the economy, the availability and price volatility of aircraft fuel and travel demand.  We presently have a $34 million valuation allowance on certain net deferred tax assets related to state NOL Carryforwards. There can be no assurance that an additional valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets will not be required. Such valuation allowance could be material.  (1)  (1)  (2)  (1)  (2)  86    Table of Contents  Recent Accounting Pronouncements ASU 2016-13: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments This ASU  requires  the  use  of  an  expected  loss model  for  certain  types  of  financial  instruments  and  requires  consideration  of  a  broader  range  of  reasonable and supportable information to calculate credit loss estimates. For trade receivables, loans and held-to-maturity debt securities, an estimate of lifetime expected credit losses is required. For available-for-sale debt securities, an allowance for credit losses will be required rather than a reduction to the carrying value of the asset. We adopted this accounting standard prospectively as of January 1, 2020, and it did not have a material  impact on our consolidated financial statements.  ASU 2020-06: Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts In An Entity\\'s Own Equity (the New Convertible Debt Standard) The New Convertible Debt Standard simplifies  the accounting  for certain convertible  instruments by  removing  the separation models  for convertible  debt with a cash conversion feature and for convertible instruments with a beneficial conversion feature. As a result, more convertible debt instruments will be  reported  as  a  single  liability  instrument  with  no  separate  accounting  for  embedded  conversion  features.  Additionally,  the  New  Convertible  Debt Standard amends the diluted earnings per share calculation for convertible instruments by requiring the use of the if-converted method. The treasury stock method  is no  longer available. Entities may adopt  the New Convertible Debt Standard using either a  full  or modified  retrospective approach, and  it  is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2021. Early adoption is permitted for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2020. The New Convertible Debt Standard is applicable to our 6.50% convertible senior notes due 2025. We early adopted the New Convertible Debt Standard as of January 1, 2021 using the modified retrospective method to recognize our 6.50% convertible senior notes as a single liability instrument. As of January 1, 2021, we recorded a $415 million ($320 million net of tax) reduction to additional paid-in capital to remove the equity  component  of  the  6.50%  convertible  senior  notes  from  our  balance  sheet  and  a  $19 million  cumulative  effect  adjustment  credit,  net  of  tax,  to retained deficit related to non-cash debt discount amortization recognized in periods prior to adoption resulting in a corresponding reduction of $389 million to the debt discount associated with the 6.50% convertible senior notes. See Note 5(h) to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A for additional information on our 6.50% convertible senior notes.  ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The risk inherent in our market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in the price of fuel, foreign  currency exchange rates and interest rates as discussed below. The sensitivity analyses presented do not consider the effects that such adverse changes may have on overall economic activity, nor do they consider additional actions we may take to mitigate our exposure to such changes. Therefore, actual results may differ. See Note 8 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A and Note 6 to American’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B for additional discussion regarding risk management matters.  Aircraft Fuel Our operating results are materially impacted by changes in the availability, price volatility and cost of aircraft fuel, which represents one of the largest  single cost items in our business. Because of the amount of fuel needed to operate our business, even a relatively small increase or decrease in the price of  aircraft  fuel  can have a material  effect  on our  operating  results  and  liquidity. Market  prices  for  aircraft  fuel  can be  volatile, with market  spot  prices ranging from a low of approximately $0.37 per gallon to a high of approximately $2.35 per gallon during the period from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2020.  As of December 31, 2020, we did not have any fuel hedging contracts outstanding to hedge our fuel consumption. We do not currently view the market opportunities to hedge fuel prices as attractive because, among other things, our future fuel needs remain unclear due to uncertainties regarding air travel demand and any hedging would potentially require significant capital or collateral to be placed at risk. As such, and assuming we do not enter into any future transactions to hedge our fuel consumption, we will continue to be fully exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices. Our current policy is not to enter into transactions to hedge our fuel consumption, although we review that policy from time to time based on market conditions and other factors. Based on our 2021  forecasted  fuel  consumption,  we  estimate  that  a  one  cent  per  gallon  increase  in  the  price  of  aircraft  fuel  would  increase  our  2021  annual  fuel expense by $38 million.  87    Table of Contents  Foreign Currency We are exposed to the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the U.S. dollar value of foreign currency-denominated transactions. Our largest  exposure comes  from  the British pound sterling, Euro, Canadian dollar and various Latin American currencies, primarily  the Brazilian  real. We do not currently have a foreign currency hedge program. We estimate a uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the U.S. dollar from 2020 levels relative to each of the currencies in which we have foreign currency exposure would have resulted in a decrease in pre-tax income of approximately $56 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.  Generally,  fluctuations  in  foreign  currencies,  including  devaluations,  cannot  be  predicted  by  us  and  can  significantly  affect  the  value  of  our  assets located outside the United States. These conditions, as well as any further delays, devaluations or  imposition of more stringent repatriation restrictions, may materially  adversely  affect  our  business,  results  of  operations  and  financial  condition.  See Part  I,  Item  1A. Risk  Factors  – “We  operate  a  global business with international operations that are subject to economic and political instability and have been, and in the future may continue to be, adversely affected by numerous events, circumstances or government actions beyond our control” for additional discussion of this and other currency risks.  Interest Our earnings and cash flow are affected by changes in interest rates due to the impact those changes have on our interest expense from variable-rate  debt instruments and our interest income from short-term, interest-bearing investments.  Our  largest  exposure  with  respect  to  variable-rate  debt  comes  from  changes  in  LIBOR.  We  had  variable-rate  debt  instruments  representing approximately 40% of our total long-term debt at December 31, 2020. We currently do not have an interest rate hedge program to hedge our exposure to floating interest rates on our variable-rate debt obligations. If annual interest rates increase 100 basis points, based on our December 31, 2020 variable- rate debt and short-term investments balances, annual interest expense on variable-rate debt would increase by approximately $130 million and annual interest  income  on  short-term  investments  would  increase  by  approximately  $70  million.  Additionally,  the  fair  value  of  fixed-rate  debt  would  have decreased by approximately $590 million for AAG and $450 million for American.  On July 27, 2017,  the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority  (the authority  that  regulates LIBOR) announced  that  it  intends  to stop compelling banks  to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. The discontinuation date for submission and publication of rates for certain tenors of USD LIBOR (1- month, 3-month, 6-month, and 12-month) is currently under consultation by the ICE Benchmark Administration (the administrator of LIBOR) and may be extended  until  June  30,  2023.  It  is  unclear whether  new methods  of  calculating  LIBOR will  be  established  such  that  it  continues  to  exist  after  2021. Similarly,  it  is not possible  to predict whether LIBOR will  continue  to be viewed as an acceptable market benchmark, what  rate or  rates may become acceptable  alternatives  to  LIBOR,  or  what  effect  these  changes  in  views  or  alternatives  may  have  on  financial  markets  for  LIBOR-linked  financial instruments. While the U.S. Federal Reserve,  in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, has chosen SOFR as the recommended risk-free reference rate for the U.S. (calculated based on repurchase agreements backed by treasury securities), we cannot currently predict the extent to which this index will gain widespread acceptance as a replacement for LIBOR. It is not possible to predict the effect of these changes, other reforms or the establishment of alternative reference rates in the United Kingdom, the United States or elsewhere.  We may  in  the  future pursue amendments  to our LIBOR-based debt  transactions  to provide  for a  transaction mechanism or other  reference  rate  in anticipation of LIBOR’s discontinuation, but we may not be able to reach agreement with our lenders on any such amendments. As of December 31, 2020, we had $12.8 billion of borrowings based on LIBOR. The replacement of LIBOR with a comparable or successor rate could cause the amount of interest payable on our long-term debt to be different or higher than expected.  88    Table of Contents '"

       "'ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  2020 Financial Overview Impact of Coronavirus (COVID-19)  COVID-19 has been declared a global health pandemic by the World Health Organization. COVID-19 has surfaced in nearly all regions of the world, which has driven  the  implementation of significant, government-imposed measures  to prevent or  reduce  its spread,  including  travel  restrictions,  testing regimes, closing of borders, “stay at home” orders and business closures. As a result, we have experienced an unprecedented decline in the demand for air travel, which has resulted in a material deterioration in our revenues. While our business performed largely as expected in January and February of 2020, a severe reduction in air travel starting in March 2020 resulted in our total operating revenues decreasing approximately 62% in 2020 as compared to 2019. While the  length and severity of  the reduction  in demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic  is uncertain, we expect our results of operations for 2021 to be severely impacted.  We have taken aggressive actions  to mitigate  the effects of  the COVID-19 pandemic on our business  including deep capacity  reductions, structural changes to our fleet, cost reductions, and steps to preserve cash and improve our overall liquidity position. We remain extremely focused on taking all self- help measures available to manage our business during this unprecedented time, consistent with the terms of the financial assistance we have received from  the U.S. Government under  the Coronavirus Aid, Relief,  and Economic Security Act  (CARES Act)  and Subtitle A of Title  IV of Division N of  the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (PSP Extension Law).  Capacity Reductions We  have  significantly  reduced  our  capacity  (as measured  by  available  seat miles),  with  2020  flying  decreasing  by  50%  year-over-year.  Domestic  capacity in 2020 was down 41% year-over-year while international capacity was down 68% year-over-year.  We also reset our international capacity and network for 2021 in response to the severe decline in demand. We have exited 19 international routes from six hubs. These changes will allow us to operate more efficiently when demand returns.  We currently expect our  first quarter 2021 system capacity  to decrease by 45% as compared to  the first quarter of 2019. The demand environment continues to be uncertain as COVID-19 cases have continued to fluctuate in jurisdictions to which we fly and travel restrictions have generally remained in place.  Due  to  this  uncertainty,  we  will  continue  to  adjust  our  future  capacity  to  match  observed  booking  trends  for  future  travel  and  make  further adjustments to our capacity as needed.  Fleet To better align our network with lower passenger demand, we accelerated the retirement of Airbus A330-200, Boeing 757, Boeing 767, Airbus A330-  300 and Embraer 190 fleets as well as certain regional aircraft, including certain Embraer 140 and Bombardier CRJ200 aircraft. These retirements remove complexity  from our operation and bring  forward  cost  savings and efficiencies associated with operating  fewer aircraft  types. See Note 1(g)  to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A for further information on the accounting for our fleet retirements. Due to the inherent uncertainties of the current operating environment, we will continue to evaluate our current fleet and may decide to permanently retire additional aircraft. In addition, we have placed a number of Boeing 737-800 and certain regional aircraft into temporary storage.  Cost Reductions We moved quickly  to better align our costs with our  reduced schedule.  In aggregate, we estimate  that we  reduced our 2020 operating and capital  expenditures  by more  than  $17  billion.  These  savings  were  achieved  primarily  through  capacity  reductions.  In  addition,  we  implemented  a  series  of actions, including the accelerated fleet retirements discussed above as well as reductions in maintenance expense and $700 million in non-aircraft capital expenditures through less fleet modification work, the elimination of ground service equipment purchases and pausing non-critical facility investments and information technology projects. We also suspended all non-essential hiring, paused non-contractual pay rate increases, reduced executive and board of director compensation,  implemented voluntary  leave and early  retirement programs and decreased our management and support staff  team,  including officers, by approximately 30%. In total, more than 20,000 team members have opted for an early retirement or long-term partially paid leave. Additionally, we have made reductions in marketing, contractor, event and training expenses as well as consolidated space at airport facilities.  65    Table of Contents  Due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, we involuntarily furloughed certain team members starting October 1, 2020, and subsequently recalled the team members covered by the PSP2 financial assistance effective December 1, 2020 (see Note 18 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A for further information).  On February 5, 2021, we informed approximately 13,000 U.S.-based team members of the possibility of a workforce reduction at their work location. We expect that any workforce reductions will take effect on or after April 1, 2021. In connection with this notification, we announced the reopening of the voluntary early out and long-term leave of absence programs for team members of certain represented workgroups. Eligible team members must opt in by February 26, 2021 for the early out program and March 12, 2021 for the voluntary leave program.  Liquidity As of December 31, 2020, we had $14.3 billion in total available liquidity, consisting of $6.9 billion in unrestricted cash and short-term investments, $7.0  billion in an undrawn term loan facility under the CARES Act and a total of $446 million in undrawn short-term revolving and other facilities.  During 2020, we completed the following financing transactions (see Note 5 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A for further information):  • refinanced the $1.2 billion 2014 Term Loan Facility at a lower interest rate and extended the maturity from 2021 to 2027;  • issued $500 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.75% unsecured senior notes due 2025;  • raised $1.0 billion from the senior secured delayed draw term loan credit facility (Delayed Draw Term Loan Credit Facility);  • borrowed $750 million under the 2013 Revolving Facility, $1.6 billion under the 2014 Revolving Facility and $450 million under the April 2016 Revolving Facility;  • issued $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of 6.50% convertible senior notes due 2025;  • issued 85.2 million shares of AAG common stock at a price of $13.50 per share and 44.3 million shares of AAG common stock at a price of $12.975 per share pursuant to two underwritten public offerings of common stock for aggregate net proceeds of $1.7 billion;  • issued $2.5 billion  in aggregate principal amount of 11.75% senior secured notes due 2025 and used the proceeds  thereof,  in part,  to repay the $1.0 billion Delayed Draw Term Loan Credit Facility that we borrowed in March 2020;  • issued  approximately  $360 million  in  special  facility  revenue  bonds,  of which  $47 million was  used  to  fund  the  redemption  of  certain outstanding bonds;  • entered into a $7.5 billion secured term loan facility with the U.S. Department of Treasury (Treasury) (the Treasury Loan Agreement), of which we borrowed $550 million;  • issued $1.2 billion in aggregate principal amount of two series of 10.75% senior secured notes due 2026 secured by various collateral;  • issued 68.6 million shares of AAG common stock at an average price of $12.87 per share pursuant to an at-the-market offering for net proceeds of $869 million (see Note 18 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A for further information);  • raised  $665 million  principally  from  aircraft  sale-leaseback  transactions  as  well  as  $351 million  from  asset  sales  primarily  related  to previously parked aircraft; and  • received  approximately  $600  million  of  proceeds  from  enhanced  equipment  trust  certificates  (EETCs)  and  other  aircraft  and  flight equipment financings, of which $17 million was used to repay existing indebtedness.  66    Table of Contents  In addition to the foregoing financings, we received an aggregate of $6.0 billion  in financial assistance through PSP1 established under the CARES Act, all of which was received by the end of September 2020. In connection with our receipt of this financial assistance, AAG issued a promissory note (the PSP1 Promissory Note)  to Treasury  for $1.8 billion  in aggregate principal amount and warrants  to purchase up  to an aggregate of approximately 14.1 million shares (the PSP1 Warrant Shares) of AAG common stock. See Note 1(b) to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A for further discussion on PSP1.  In January 2021, we received $1.5 billion (of an expected total of at least $3.0 billion) in financial assistance through PSP2 established under the PSP Extension Law. In connection with our receipt of this financial assistance, AAG issued a promissory note (the PSP2 Promissory Note) to Treasury for an initial principal sum of approximately $433 million and warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of approximately 2.8 million shares (the PSP2 Warrant Shares) of AAG common stock. See Note 18 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A for further discussion on PSP2.  Also, we are permitted  to,  and have, deferred payment of  the employer portion of Social Security  taxes  through  the end of 2020  (with 50% of  the deferred amount due December 31, 2021 and the remaining 50% due December 31, 2022). This deferral provided approximately $350 million in additional liquidity during 2020. Additionally, we have suspended our capital return program, including share repurchases and the payment of future dividends for at least the period that the restrictions imposed by the CARES Act and the PSP Extension Law are applicable.  We continue to evaluate future financing opportunities and work with third-party appraisers on valuations of our remaining unencumbered assets.  A significant portion of our debt financing agreements contain covenants requiring us to maintain an aggregate of at  least $2.0 billion of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and amounts available to be drawn under revolving credit facilities and/or contain loan to value, collateral coverage and/or debt service coverage ratio covenants.  Given the above actions and our current assumptions about the future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on travel demand, which could be materially different due to the inherent uncertainties of the current operating environment, we expect to meet our cash obligations as well as remain in compliance with  the  debt  covenants  in  our  existing  financing  agreements  for  the  next  12 months  based  on  our  current  level  of  unrestricted  cash  and  short-term investments, our anticipated access to liquidity (including via proceeds from financings and funds from government assistance obtained pursuant to the CARES Act and the PSP Extension Law) and projected cash flows from operations.  See Note 5 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A for additional information on our debt obligations.  67    Table of Contents  AAG’s 2020 Results The selected financial data presented below is derived from AAG’s audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8A of this report  and should be read in conjunction with those financial statements and the related notes thereto.

Not meaningful or greater than 100% change.  Pre-Tax Income (Loss) and Net Income (Loss) Pre-tax loss and net loss were $11.5 billion and $8.9 billion, respectively, in 2020. This compares to 2019 pre-tax income and net income of $2.3 billion  and $1.7 billion, respectively. The year-over-year decrease in our pre-tax income was principally driven by lower revenues as a result of a severe decline in passenger demand and government travel restrictions related to the outbreak and spread of COVID-19. This decline in revenues was offset in part by a decrease in expenses due to our reduced schedule and cost reduction actions described above. Additionally, we recognized $796 million of net special credits  in  2020  driven  principally  by  the  PSP1  financial  assistance  (the  PSP1  Financial Assistance),  offset  in  part  by  severance  expenses  and  fleet impairment charges. See Notes 1 and 2  to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements  in Part  II,  Item 8A  for  further  information on  the PSP1 Financial Assistance and net special items, respectively.  Excluding the effects of pre-tax net special items, pre-tax loss was $12.2 billion in 2020 and pre-tax income was $2.9 billion in 2019. The year-over- year decrease  in our pre-tax  income excluding pre-tax net special  items was principally driven by  lower  revenues and decreased expenses due  to our reduced schedule and cost reduction actions as described above.  Revenue In 2020, we reported total operating revenues of $17.3 billion, a decrease of $28.4 billion, or 62.1%, as compared to 2019. Passenger revenue was  $14.5 billion, a decrease of $27.5 billion, or 65.4%, as compared to 2019. The decrease in passenger revenue in 2020 was due to a severe decline  in passenger demand and government  travel  restrictions  related  to  the COVID-19 pandemic,  resulting  in a 61.9% decrease  in  revenue passenger miles (RPMs) and a 20.5 point decrease in passenger load factor.  (2)  (1)  (1)  (2)  68    Table of Contents  In 2020, cargo revenue was $769 million, a decrease of $94 million, or 10.8%, as compared to 2019, primarily due to a 44.4% decrease in cargo ton miles reflecting declines in freight volumes, principally as a result of international schedule reductions, which was offset in part by a 60.5% increase in yield as a result of rate increases.  Other operating revenue decreased $845 million, or 29.2%, in 2020 as compared to 2019, driven primarily by lower revenue associated with our loyalty program and airport clubs.  Our total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM) was 12.11 cents in 2020, a 24.6% decrease as compared to 16.05 cents in 2019.  Fuel Our mainline and  regional  fuel expense  totaled $3.4 billion  in 2020, which was $6.0 billion, or 63.8%,  lower compared  to 2019. This decrease was  primarily driven by a 49.4% decrease in gallons of fuel consumed as a result of lower capacity and a 28.5% decrease in the average price per gallon of aircraft fuel including related taxes to $1.48 in 2020 from $2.07 in 2019.  As of December 31, 2020, we did not have any fuel hedging contracts outstanding to hedge our fuel consumption. Our current policy is not to enter into transactions to hedge our fuel consumption, although we review that policy from time to time based on market conditions and other factors. We do not currently  view  the market  opportunities  to  hedge  fuel  prices  as  attractive  because,  among  other  things,  our  future  fuel  needs  remain  unclear  due  to uncertainties  regarding air  travel  demand and any hedging would potentially  require  significant  capital  or  collateral  to  be placed at  risk. As  such,  and assuming we do not enter into any future transactions to hedge our fuel consumption, we will continue to be fully exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices.  Other Costs We remain committed  to actively managing our cost structure, which we believe  is necessary  in an  industry whose economic prospects are heavily  dependent upon two variables we cannot control: general economic conditions and the price of fuel. In particular, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a very rapid deterioration in general economic conditions, particularly as applicable to the travel industry.  Our 2020 total cost per available seat mile (CASM) was 19.39 cents, an increase of 29.4%, from 14.98 cents in 2019. Lower than planned capacity in 2020 due to decreased passenger demand and government travel restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic drove the increase in our CASM, offset in part by the PSP1 Financial Assistance recognized in 2020.  Our 2020 CASM excluding net special  items and fuel was 17.69 cents, an increase of 54.4%, from 11.46 cents in 2019. The increase was primarily driven by lower capacity in 2020 as described above.  For a reconciliation of total operating  CASM to total operating CASM excluding net special items and fuel, see Part II, Item 6. Selected Consolidated Financial Data – “Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”  69    Table of Contents  AAG’s Results of Operations As discussed above, our results of operations for 2020 were significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Depreciation and amortization increased $58 million, or 3.0%, in 2020 from 2019 due in part to accelerated depreciation for certain aircraft and related equipment expected to be retired earlier than planned. Depreciation associated with facility improvements also contributed to the increase.  71    Table of Contents  Operating Special Items, Net    Year Ended December 31,          2020 2019   (In millions) PSP1 Financial Assistance  $ (3,710) $ —  Fleet impairment  1,484  213  Severance expenses  1,408  11  Labor contract expenses  228  —  Mark-to-market adjustments on bankruptcy obligations, net  (49) (11) Fleet restructuring expenses  —  271  Merger integration expenses  —  191  Litigation reserve adjustments —  (53) Other operating special items, net (18) 13   Mainline operating special items, net (657) 635   PSP1 Financial Assistance  (444) —  Fleet impairment  117  —  Severance expenses  18  —  Other operating special items, net —  6   Regional operating special items, net (309) 6  Operating special items, net $ (966) $ 641   PSP1 Financial Assistance represents recognition of financial assistance received from Treasury pursuant to the PSP1 Agreement. See Note 1(b) to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A for further information.  The 2020 fleet impairment resulted from our decision to retire certain aircraft earlier than planned driven by the severe decline in air travel due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Aircraft  retired  include Airbus A330-200, Boeing 757, Boeing 767, Airbus A330-300, Embraer 190, certain Embraer 140 and Bombardier CRJ200 aircraft. This  included a $1.5 billion non-cash write-down of mainline and regional aircraft and spare parts and $109 million  in cash charges primarily for impairment of right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease return costs. See Note 1(g) to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A for further information related to these charges.  The 2019 fleet impairment principally included a non-cash write-down of aircraft related to the retirement of our Embraer 190 fleet.  The 2020 severance expenses  included salary and medical costs primarily associated with certain  team members who opted  in  to voluntary early retirement programs offered as a result of reductions to our operation due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Cash payments related to these charges for the year ended December 31, 2020 were approximately $365 million.  The 2019 severance expenses primarily included costs associated with reductions of management and support staff team members.  Labor contract expenses primarily related to one-time charges resulting from the ratification of a new contract with the TWU-IAM Association for our maintenance and fleet service team members, including signing bonuses and adjustments to vacation accruals resulting from pay rate increases.  Bankruptcy obligations that will be settled in shares of AAG common stock are marked-to-market based on AAG’s stock price.  Fleet restructuring expenses principally included accelerated depreciation and rent expense for aircraft and related equipment expected to be retired earlier than planned.

Interest  expense,  net increased in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to the issuance of debt and lower capitalized interest offset  in part by lower interest expense on our variable-rate debt.  In  2020,  other  nonoperating  income,  net  included  $329 million  of  non-service  related  pension  and  other  postretirement  benefit  plan  income.  This income was offset in part by $170 million of net special charges principally for mark-to-market unrealized losses associated with our equity investment in China Southern Airlines  and  certain  treasury  rate  lock  derivative  instruments  and $24 million  of  net  foreign  currency  losses,  primarily  associated with losses from Latin American currencies.  In 2019, other nonoperating income, net principally included $183 million of non-service related pension and other postretirement benefit plan income. This income was offset in part by $32 million of net foreign currency losses, primarily associated with losses from Latin American currencies.  The increase in non-service related pension and other postretirement benefit plan income in 2020 as compared to 2019 is principally due to an increase in the expected return on pension plan assets.  Income Taxes In 2020, we  recorded an  income  tax benefit of $2.6 billion at an effective  rate of approximately 22%. Substantially all of our  income or  loss before  income taxes is attributable to the United States. At December 31, 2020, we had approximately $16.5 billion of federal NOLs available to reduce future federal  taxable  income,  of which  $8.5  billion will  expire  beginning  in  2023  if  unused and $8.0  billion  can  be  carried  forward  indefinitely. We also  had approximately $5.0 billion of NOL Carryforwards  to  reduce  future state  taxable  income at December 31, 2020, which will expire  in  taxable years 2020 through 2040 if unused.  In 2019, we recorded an income tax provision of $570 million at an effective rate of approximately 25%, which was substantially non-cash.  See Note 7 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A for additional information on income taxes.  American’s Results of Operations As discussed above, American’s results of operations for 2020 were significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, the comparison of  American’s 2020  financial  results  to 2019 are  largely not meaningful.

This income  was  offset  in  part  by  $170  million  of  net  special  charges  principally  for  mark-to-market  unrealized  losses  associated  with American’s  equity investment  in  China  Southern Airlines  and  certain  treasury  rate  lock  derivative  instruments  and  $24  million  of  net  foreign  currency  losses,  primarily associated with losses from Latin American currencies.  In 2019, other nonoperating income, net principally included $183 million of non-service related pension and other postretirement benefit plan income. This income was offset in part by $32 million of net foreign currency losses, primarily associated with losses from Latin American currencies.  The increase in non-service related pension and other postretirement benefit plan income in 2020 as compared to 2019 is principally due to an increase in the expected return on pension plan assets.  Income Taxes American is a member of AAG’s consolidated federal and certain state income tax returns.  In 2020, American recorded an income tax benefit of $2.5 billion at an effective rate of approximately 22%. Substantially all of American’s income or loss before income taxes is attributable to the United States. At December 31, 2020, American had approximately $16.5 billion of federal NOLs available to reduce  future  federal  taxable  income, of which $8.9 billion will  expire beginning  in 2023  if  unused and $7.6 billion  can be  carried  forward  indefinitely. American also had approximately $5.0 billion of NOL Carryforwards  to  reduce  future state  taxable  income at December 31, 2020, which will expire  in taxable years 2020 through 2040 if unused.  In 2019, American recorded an income tax provision of $633 million at an effective rate of approximately 24%, which was substantially non-cash.  See Note 5 to American’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B for additional information on income taxes.  76    Table of Contents  Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity  At December 31, 2020, AAG had $14.3 billion in total available liquidity and $609 million in restricted cash and short-term investments. Additional detail regarding our available liquidity is provided in the table below (in millions):    AAG American   December 31, December 31,   2020 2019 2020 2019 Cash $ 245  $ 280  $ 231  $ 267  Short-term investments 6,619  3,546  6,617  3,543  Undrawn facilities 7,396  3,243  7,396  3,243   Total available liquidity $ 14,260  $ 7,069  $ 14,244  $ 7,053   Given the actions we have taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and our assumptions about its future impact on travel demand, which could be materially different due to the current inherent uncertainties of the current operating environment, we expect to meet our cash obligations as well as remain in compliance with the debt covenants in our existing financing agreements for the next 12 months based on our current level of unrestricted cash and short-term investments, our anticipated access to  liquidity (including via proceeds from financings and funds from government assistance obtained pursuant to the CARES Act and the PSP Extension Law) and projected cash flows from operations.  Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends In 2020, we repurchased 6.4 million shares of AAG common stock for $145 million at a weighted average cost per share of $22.77, all of which were  purchased in the first quarter of 2020.  In January 2020, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.10 per share for stockholders of record as of February 5, 2020 and paid on February 19, 2020, totaling $43 million.  We have suspended our capital  return program,  including share repurchases and the payment of  future dividends.  In connection with our receipt of financial assistance under PSP1 and PSP2, we agreed not to repurchase shares of or make dividend payments in respect of AAG common stock through at  least March 31, 2022. In addition, we have entered into the Treasury Loan Agreement, and, as a result, we are further prohibited from repurchasing shares of AAG common stock and paying dividends on AAG common stock through the date that is one year after the secured loan provided under the Treasury Loan Agreement is fully repaid.  Certain Covenants Certain of our debt financing agreements (including our secured notes, term loans, revolving credit facilities and spare engine EETCs) contain loan to  value  (LTV)  or  collateral  coverage  ratio  covenants  and  require  us  to  appraise  the  related  collateral  annually  or  semiannually.  Pursuant  to  such agreements,  if  the  LTV  or  collateral  coverage  ratio  exceeds  a  specified  threshold  or  if  the  value  of  the  appraised  collateral  fails  to meet  a  specified threshold,  as  the  case may  be,  we  are  required,  as  applicable,  to  pledge  additional  qualifying  collateral  (which  in  some  cases may  include  cash  or investment securities), or pay down such financing, in whole or in part, or the interest rate for the financing under such agreements will be increased. As of the most recent applicable measurement dates, we were in compliance with each of the foregoing collateral coverage tests. Additionally, a significant portion of our debt financing agreements contain covenants requiring us to maintain an aggregate of at  least $2.0 billion of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and amounts available  to be drawn under  revolving credit  facilities, and our Treasury Term Loan Facility contains a debt service coverage ratio, pursuant  to which  failure  to comply with a certain  threshold may  result  in mandatory prepayment of  the Treasury Term Loan Facility. For  further information  regarding  our  debt  covenants,  see  Note  5  to  AAG’s  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  in  Part  II,  Item  8A  and  Note  3  to  American’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B.  77    Table of Contents  Sources and Uses of Cash For  a  comparison of  the  2019 and 2018  reporting  periods,  see Part  II,  Item 7. Management’s Discussion  and Analysis  of  Financial Condition  and  Results of Operations – “Sources and Uses of Cash”  of our 2019 Form 10-K.  AAG Operating Activities Our net cash used in operating activities was $6.5 billion in 2020 as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $3.8 billion in 2019. The  $10.4 billion year-over-year decrease in operating cash flows was primarily due to a net  loss  in 2020. The net  loss was driven by  lower revenues as a result of a severe decline in passenger demand and government travel restrictions related to the outbreak and spread of COVID-19, offset  in part by a decrease in expenses due to our reduced schedule and cost reduction actions. Additionally, we received cash proceeds of $4.2 billion in 2020 associated with the PSP1 Financial Assistance. In 2020, we also recorded a $1.4 billion special charge for salary and medical costs primarily associated with certain team members who opted in to voluntary early retirement programs. Approximately $365 million of this charge has been paid to team members in 2020. We expect cash payments under these programs of approximately $600 million in 2021 with the remaining payments in 2022 and beyond.  Investing Activities Our net cash used in investing activities was $4.3 billion and $2.2 billion in 2020 and 2019, respectively.  Our principal investing activities in 2020 included $3.1 billion in net purchases of short-term investments, expenditures of $2.0 billion for property and equipment,  including  16  Airbus  A321neo  aircraft,  eight  Embraer  175  aircraft,  three  Bombardier  CRJ900  aircraft  and  the  harmonization  of  interior configurations across  the mainline  fleet as well as a $308 million  increase  in  restricted short-term  investments primarily  related  to cash proceeds  from special  facility  revenue bonds. These cash outflows were offset  in part by $665 million of proceeds primarily  from aircraft sale-leaseback  transactions, $351 million of proceeds from the sale of property and equipment and $90 million of proceeds from a vendor.  Our  principal  investing  activities  in  2019  included  expenditures  of  $4.3  billion  for  property  and  equipment,  including  21  Embraer  175  aircraft,  12 Bombardier CRJ900 aircraft, 12 Airbus A321neo aircraft, four Boeing 737 MAX Family aircraft and two Boeing 787 Family aircraft. These cash outflows were offset in part by $960 million in net sales of short-term investments, $850 million of proceeds primarily from aircraft sale-leaseback transactions and $250 million in proceeds from a vendor.  Financing Activities Our net cash provided by financing activities was $11.0 billion in 2020 as compared to net cash used in financing activities of $1.6 billion in 2019.  Our principal financing activities in 2020 included $11.8 billion in proceeds from the issuance of debt and $3.0 billion in proceeds from the issuance of equity.  These  proceeds  principally  include  $2.8  billion  borrowed  under  the  2014  Revolving  Facility,  the  2013  Revolving  Facility  and  the  April  2016 Revolving Facility, $2.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of 11.75% senior secured notes, $1.8 billion in aggregate principal amount under the PSP1 Promissory Note, $1.2 billion  in aggregate principal amount of  two series of 10.75% senior secured notes due 2026, $1.0 billion  in aggregate principal amount  of AAG’s  6.50% convertible  senior  notes,  $1.0  billion  under  the Delayed Draw Term Loan Credit  Facility,  $600 million  in  connection with  the issuance of equipment notes related to EETCs and the financing of certain aircraft, $550 million under the Treasury Term Loan Facility, $500 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.75% unsecured senior notes due 2025 and the $360 million issuance of special  facility revenue bonds as well as $1.7 billion of net proceeds from two underwritten public offerings of common stock and $869 million of net proceeds from an at-the-market offering of common stock. These cash inflows were offset  in part by $3.5 billion  in debt repayments, consisting of approximately $2.5 billion  in scheduled debt repayments, including repayment of $500 million of 4.625% senior notes, and the prepayment of the $1.0 billion Delayed Draw Term Loan Credit Facility, as well as $216 million in share repurchases and dividend payments (which occurred in the first quarter of 2020).  78    Table of Contents  Our  principal  financing  activities  in  2019  included  $4.2  billion  in  debt  repayments,  consisting  of  $2.9  billion  in  scheduled  debt  repayments  and  the prepayment of $1.3 billion of secured loans. We also had $1.1 billion in share repurchases and $178 million in dividend payments. These cash outflows were offset  in part by $4.0 billion  in proceeds  from  the  issuance of debt, consisting of $3.2 billion  in connection with  the  issuance of equipment notes related to EETCs and the financing of certain aircraft and other flight equipment, as well as the issuance of $750 million aggregate principal amount of 5.000% senior notes.  American Operating Activities American’s net cash used  in operating activities was $1.4 billion  in 2020 as compared  to net cash provided by operating activities of $2.4 billion  in  2019. The  $3.9  billion  year-over-year  decrease  in  operating  cash  flows was  primarily  due  to  a  net  loss  in  2020,  offset  in  part  by  intercompany  cash receipts  from AAG\\'s  financing  transactions.  The  net  loss  was  driven  by  lower  revenues  as  a  result  of  a  severe  decline  in  passenger  demand  and government  travel  restrictions  related  to  the  outbreak  and  spread  of COVID-19,  offset  in  part  by  a  decrease  in  expenses  due  to American\\'s  reduced schedule and cost reduction actions. Additionally, American received cash proceeds of $3.7 billion in 2020 associated with the PSP1 Financial Assistance. In 2020, American also recorded a $1.4 billion special charge for salary and medical costs primarily associated with certain team members who opted in to voluntary early retirement programs. Approximately $365 million of this charge has been paid to team members in 2020. American expects cash payments under these programs of approximately $600 million in 2021 with the remaining payments in 2022 and beyond.  Investing Activities American’s net cash used in investing activities was $4.3 billion and $2.1 billion in 2020 and 2019, respectively.  American’s  principal  investing  activities  in  2020  included  $3.1  billion  in  net  purchases  of  short-term  investments,  expenditures  of  $1.9  billion  for property and equipment,  including 16 Airbus A321neo aircraft, eight Embraer 175 aircraft,  three Bombardier CRJ900 aircraft and  the harmonization of interior configurations across the mainline fleet as well as a $308 million increase in restricted short-term investments primarily related to cash proceeds from special facility revenue bonds. These cash outflows were offset in part by $665 million of proceeds primarily from aircraft sale-leaseback transactions, $351 million of proceeds from the sale of property and equipment and $90 million of proceeds from a vendor.  American’s principal investing activities in 2019 included expenditures of $4.2 billion for property and equipment, including 21 Embraer 175 aircraft, 12 Bombardier CRJ900 aircraft, 12 Airbus A321neo aircraft, four Boeing 737 MAX Family aircraft and two Boeing 787 Family aircraft. These cash outflows were offset in part by $960 million in net sales of short-term investments, $850 million of proceeds primarily from aircraft sale-leaseback transactions and $250 million in proceeds from a vendor.  Financing Activities American’s net cash provided by  financing activities was $5.8 billion  in 2020 as compared  to net cash used  in  financing activities of $282 million  in  2019.  American’s principal financing activities in 2020 included $9.0 billion in proceeds from the issuance of debt, including $2.8 billion borrowed under the 2014 Revolving Facility,  the 2013 Revolving Facility and  the April 2016 Revolving Facility, $2.5 billion  in aggregate principal amount of 11.75% senior secured notes, $1.2 billion  in aggregate principal amount of  two series of 10.75% senior secured notes due 2026, $1.0 billion under the Delayed Draw Term Loan Credit Facility, $600 million in connection with the issuance of equipment notes related to EETCs and the financing of certain aircraft, $550 million under the Treasury Term Loan Facility and the $360 million issuance of special facility revenue bonds. These cash inflows were offset in part by $3.0 billion  in debt  repayments, consisting of approximately $2.0 billion  in scheduled debt  repayments and  the prepayment of  the $1.0 billion Delayed Draw Term Loan Credit Facility.  American’s principal financing activities in 2019 included $3.4 billion in debt repayments, consisting of $2.1 billion in scheduled debt repayments and the  prepayment  of  $1.3  billion  of  secured  loans.  These  cash  outflows  were  offset  in  part  by  $3.2  billion  in  proceeds  from  the  issuance  of  debt  for equipment notes related to EETCs and the financing of certain aircraft and other flight equipment.  79    Table of Contents  Commitments For  further  information regarding our commitments, see  the Notes  to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements  in Part  II,  Item 8A and  the Notes  to  American’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B at the referenced footnotes below.    AAG    American Long-term debt and debt covenants Note 5    Note 3 Leases Note 6 Note 4 Employee benefit plans Note 10    Note 8 Commitments, contingencies and guarantees Note 12    Note 10  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements An off-balance sheet arrangement  is any  transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement  involving an unconsolidated entity under which a  company has (1) made guarantees, (2) a retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets, (3) an obligation under derivative instruments classified as equity or (4) any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to us, or that engages in leasing, hedging or research and development arrangements with us.  We have no off-balance sheet arrangements of the types described in the first three categories above that we believe may have a material current or future effect on financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.  Pass-Through Trusts American currently operates 350 owned aircraft and 24  leased aircraft, and owns 62 spare aircraft engines, which  in each case were  financed with  EETCs  issued  by  pass-through  trusts. These  trusts  are  off-balance  sheet  entities,  the  primary  purpose  of which  is  to  finance  the  acquisition  of  flight equipment or to permit  issuance of debt backed by existing flight equipment. In the case of aircraft EETCs, rather than finance each aircraft separately when such aircraft  is purchased, delivered or  refinanced,  these  trusts allow American  to raise  the  financing  for a number of aircraft at one  time and,  if applicable, place such funds in escrow pending a future purchase, delivery or refinancing of the relevant aircraft. Similarly, in the case of the spare engine EETCs, the trusts allow American to use its existing pool of spare engines to raise financing under a single facility. The trusts have also been structured to provide for certain credit enhancements, such as liquidity facilities to cover certain interest payments, that reduce the risks to the purchasers of the trust certificates and, as a result, reduce the cost of aircraft financing to American.  Each trust covers a set number of aircraft or spare engines scheduled to be delivered, financed or refinanced upon the issuance of the EETC or within a specific period of time thereafter. At the time of each covered aircraft or spare engine financing, the relevant trust used the proceeds of the issuance of the EETC (which may have been available at the time of issuance thereof or held in escrow until financing of the applicable aircraft following its delivery) to purchase  equipment  notes  relating  to  the  financed  aircraft  or  engines. The  equipment  notes  are  issued,  at American’s  election,  in  connection with  a mortgage financing of the aircraft or spare engines or, in certain cases, by a separate owner trust in connection with a leveraged lease financing of the aircraft. In the case of a leveraged lease financing, the owner trust then leases the aircraft to American. In both cases, the equipment notes are secured by a security  interest  in  the aircraft or engines, as applicable. The pass-through trust certificates are not direct obligations of, nor are  they guaranteed by, AAG or American. However, in the case of mortgage financings, the equipment notes issued to the trusts are direct obligations of American and, in certain instances, have been guaranteed by AAG. As of December 31, 2020, $11.0 billion associated with these mortgage financings is reflected as debt in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.  With  respect  to  leveraged  leases, American evaluated whether  the  leases had characteristics of  a  variable  interest entity. American concluded  the leasing  entities  met  the  criteria  for  variable  interest  entities;  however,  American  concluded  it  is  not  the  primary  beneficiary  under  these  leasing arrangements and accounts for the majority of its EETC leveraged lease financings as operating leases. American’s total future payments to the trusts of each of the relevant EETCs under these leveraged lease financings are $78 million as of December 31, 2020, which are reflected in the operating lease obligations in Note 6 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A and Note 4 to American’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B.  80    Table of Contents  Letters of Credit and Other We provide  financial  assurance,  such  as  letters  of  credit,  surety  bonds  or  restricted  cash  and  investments,  primarily  to  support  projected workers’  compensation obligations and airport commitments. As of December 31, 2020, we had $476 million of letters of credit and surety bonds securing various obligations, of which $110 million is collateralized with our restricted cash. The letters of credit and surety bonds that are subject to expiration will expire on various dates through 2024.  Contractual Obligations The following table provides details of our future cash contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020 (in millions). Except to the extent set forth in the  applicable accompanying footnotes, the table does not include commitments that are contingent on events or other factors that are uncertain or unknown at this time.

Amounts represent contractual amounts due. Excludes $321 million and $428 million of unamortized debt discount, premium and issuance costs as of December 31, 2020 for American and AAG Parent, respectively.  For variable-rate debt, future interest obligations are estimated using the current forward rates at December 31, 2020.  Includes $11.0 billion of future principal payments and $1.9 billion of future interest payments as of December 31, 2020, related to EETCs associated with mortgage financings of certain aircraft and spare engines.  See Part  I,  Item 2. Properties –  “Aircraft and Engine Purchase Commitments”  for additional  information about the firm commitment aircraft delivery schedule,  in particular  the  footnotes  to  the  table  thereunder as  to potential changes  to such delivery schedule. Due  to uncertainty surrounding  the timing of delivery of certain aircraft, the amounts in the  (a)  (b), (d)   (c), (d)  (e)     (f)  (g)   (h)   (a)  (b)   (c)  (g)   (a)  (b)  (c)  (d)  (e)  81    Table of Contents  table represent our current best estimate; however, the actual delivery schedule may differ from the table above, potentially materially. Additionally, the  amounts  in  the  table  exclude  19  Boeing  787-8  aircraft  to  be  delivered  in  2021  for  which  we  have  obtained  committed  lease  financing.  This financing is reflected in the operating lease commitments line above.  Represents minimum payments under capacity purchase agreements with  third-party  regional carriers. These commitments are estimates of costs based  on  assumed  minimum  levels  of  flying  under  the  capacity  purchase  agreements  and  our  actual  payments  could  differ  materially.  Rental payments  under  operating  leases  for  certain  aircraft  flown  under  these  capacity  purchase  agreements  are  reflected  in  the  operating  lease commitments line above.  Includes minimum pension contributions based on actuarially determined estimates as of December 31, 2020 and is based on estimated payments through 2030. Pursuant to the CARES Act passed in March 2020, minimum required pension contributions to be made in the calendar year 2020 can be deferred to January 1, 2021, with interest accruing from the original due date to the new payment date. In January 2021, we made $241 million of required pension contributions, including the $130 million minimum contributions required for 2020.  Includes purchase commitments for aircraft fuel, flight equipment maintenance, construction projects and information technology support.  Capital Raising Activity and Other Possible Actions In  light of  the cash needs  imposed by  the current operating  losses due  to  reduced demand  in  response  to  the COVID-19 pandemic as well as our  significant  financial  commitments  related  to,  among other  things,  new  flight  equipment,  the  servicing and amortization of  existing  debt  and equipment leasing  arrangements,  and  pension  funding  obligations, we  and  our  subsidiaries will  regularly  consider,  and  enter  into  negotiations  related  to,  capital raising and  liability management  activity, which may  include  the entry  into  leasing  transactions and  future  issuances of,  and  transactions  designed  to manage the timing and amount of, secured or unsecured debt obligations or additional equity securities  in public or private offerings or otherwise. The cash available from operations (if any) and these sources, however, may not be sufficient to cover our cash obligations because economic factors may reduce the amount of cash generated by operations or increase costs. For instance, an economic downturn or general global instability caused by military actions, terrorism, disease outbreaks (in particular the ongoing global outbreak of COVID-19), natural disasters or other causes could reduce the demand for air travel, which would reduce the amount of cash generated by operations. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors – \"The outbreak and global spread of COVID-19 has resulted in a severe decline in demand for air travel which has adversely impacted our business, operating results, financial condition and liquidity. The duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, and similar public health threats that we may face in the future, could result in additional adverse  effects  on  our  business,  operating  results,  financial  condition  and  liquidity\" for  additional  discussion. An  increase  in  costs,  either  due  to  an increase  in  borrowing  costs  caused  by  a  reduction  in  credit  ratings  or  a  general  increase  in  interest  rates,  or  due  to  an  increase  in  the  cost  of  fuel, maintenance, aircraft, aircraft engines or parts, could decrease the amount of cash available to cover cash contractual obligations. Moreover, certain of our financing arrangements contain significant minimum cash balance or similar liquidity requirements. As a result, we cannot use all of our available cash to fund operations, capital expenditures and cash obligations without violating these requirements. See Note 5 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A and Note 3 to American’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B for information regarding our financing arrangements.  In  the  past, we  have  from  time  to  time  refinanced,  redeemed  or  repurchased  our  debt  and  taken  other  steps  to  reduce  or  otherwise manage  the aggregate  amount  and  cost  of  our  debt,  lease  and  other  obligations  or  otherwise  improve  our  balance  sheet.  Going  forward,  depending  on  market conditions, our cash position and other considerations, we may continue to take such actions.  OTHER INFORMATION Basis of Presentation  See Note 1  to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements  in Part  II,  Item 8A and Note 1  to American’s Consolidated Financial Statements  in Part  II, Item 8B for information regarding the basis of presentation.  (f)  (g)  (h)  82    Table of Contents  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of  financial statements  in accordance with GAAP requires management  to make certain estimates and assumptions  that affect  the  reported  amounts  of  assets  and  liabilities,  revenues  and  expenses,  and  the  disclosure  of  contingent  assets  and  liabilities  at  the  date  of  the  financial statements. We believe  our  estimates  and assumptions  are  reasonable;  however,  actual  results  could  differ  from  those  estimates. Critical  accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. We have identified the following critical accounting policies that impact the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.  See  the  “Basis  of  Presentation  and  Summary  of  Significant Accounting  Policies ”  included  in  Note  1  to  each  of AAG’s  and American’s Consolidated  Financial  Statements  in  Part  II,  Item  8A  and  8B,  respectively,  for  additional  discussion  of  the  application  of  these  estimates  and  other accounting policies.  Passenger Revenue We  recognize  all  revenues  generated  from  transportation  on American  and  our  regional  flights  operated  under  the  brand  name American  Eagle,  including associated baggage fees and other inflight services, as passenger revenue when transportation is provided. Ticket and other related sales for transportation that has not yet been provided are  initially deferred and recorded as air  traffic  liability on our consolidated balance sheets. The air  traffic liability principally represents tickets sold for future travel on American and partner airlines, as well as estimated future refunds and exchanges of tickets sold for past travel.  The majority of tickets sold are nonrefundable. A small percentage of tickets, some of which are partially used tickets, expire unused. Due to complex pricing structures, refund and exchange policies, and interline agreements with other airlines, certain amounts are recognized in passenger revenue using estimates regarding both the timing of the revenue recognition and the amount of revenue to be recognized. These estimates are generally based on the analysis  of  our  historical  data.  We  have  consistently  applied  this  accounting  method  to  estimate  revenue  from  unused  tickets  at  the  date  of  travel. Estimated future refunds and exchanges included in the air traffic liability are routinely evaluated based on subsequent activity to validate the accuracy of our estimates. Any adjustments resulting from periodic evaluations of the estimated air traffic liability are included in passenger revenue during the period in which the evaluations are completed. While the contract duration of passenger tickets is generally one year, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we extended the contract duration for certain tickets to December 31, 2021, principally those with travel scheduled from March 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020. Additionally, we have eliminated change fees for most domestic and international tickets. As of December 31, 2020, the air traffic liability included approximately $2.6 billion of travel credits related to these unused tickets for travel prior to December 31, 2020. Accordingly, any revenue associated with these tickets will be recognized within the next 12 months. Given this change in contract duration and uncertainty surrounding the future demand for air travel, our estimates of revenue that will be recognized from the air traffic liability for future flown or unused tickets as well as our estimates of refunds may be subject to variability and differ from historical experience.  Various taxes and fees assessed on the sale of tickets to end customers are collected by us as an agent and remitted to taxing authorities. These taxes and fees have been presented on a net basis in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and recorded as a liability until remitted to the appropriate taxing authority. The CARES Act provided for a temporary tax holiday from collecting and remitting certain government ticket taxes for tickets purchased between March 28, 2020 and December 31, 2020.  Loyalty Revenue We currently operate the loyalty program, AAdvantage. This program awards mileage credits to passengers who fly on American, any  oneworld airline  or other partner airlines, or by using the services of other program participants, such as the Citi and Barclaycard US co-branded credit cards, and certain hotels and car rental companies. Mileage credits can be redeemed for travel on American and other participating partner airlines, as well as other non-air travel  awards  such  as  hotels  and  rental  cars.  For mileage  credits  earned  by AAdvantage  loyalty  program members,  we  apply  the  deferred  revenue method.  In  response  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  we  suspended  the  expiration  of  mileage  credits  through  June  30,  2021  and  eliminated  mileage reinstatement fees for canceled award tickets.  Mileage credits earned through travel For mileage credits earned through travel, we apply a relative selling price approach whereby the total amount collected from each passenger ticket  sale is allocated between the air transportation and the mileage credits earned. The portion of each passenger ticket sale attributable to mileage credits earned is initially deferred and then recognized in passenger revenue when mileage credits are redeemed and transportation is provided. The estimated selling price of  83    Table of Contents  mileage credits is determined using an equivalent ticket value approach, which uses historical data, including award redemption patterns by geographic region and class of service, as well as similar  fares as  those used  to settle award redemptions. The estimated selling price of miles  is adjusted  for an estimate of the miles that will not be redeemed using statistical models based on historical redemption patterns to develop an estimate of the likelihood of future  redemption.  Given  the  inherent  uncertainty  of  the  current  operating  environment  due  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  we  will  continue  to  monitor redemption patterns and may adjust our estimates in the future. For the year ended December 31, 2020, a hypothetical 10% increase in the estimated selling price of miles would have decreased revenues by approximately $40 million as a result of additional amounts deferred from passenger ticket sales to be recognized in future periods.  Mileage credits sold to co-branded credit cards and other partners We  sell  mileage  credits  to  participating  airline  partners  and  non-airline  business  partners,  including  our  co-branded  credit  card  partners,  under  contracts with terms extending generally for one to seven years. Consideration received from the sale of mileage credits is variable and payment terms typically  are within 30 days  subsequent  to  the month of mileage sale. Sales of mileage credits  to  non-airline business partners are  comprised of  two components, transportation and marketing. We allocate the consideration received from these sales of mileage credits based on the relative selling price of each product or service delivered.  Our most significant partner agreements are our co-branded credit card agreements with Citi and Barclaycard US. We identified the following revenue elements in these co-branded credit card agreements: the transportation component; and the use of  intellectual property,  including the American brand and  access  to  loyalty  program member  lists, which  is  the  predominant  element  in  the  agreements,  as well  as  advertising  (collectively,  the marketing component). Accordingly, we  recognize  the marketing component  in other  revenue  in  the period of  the mileage sale  following  the sales-based  royalty method.  The transportation component represents the estimated selling price of future travel awards and is determined using the same equivalent ticket value approach described above. The portion of each mileage credit sold attributable  to  transportation  is  initially deferred and  then  recognized  in passenger revenue when mileage credits are redeemed and transportation is provided.  For  the portion of our outstanding mileage credits  that we estimate will  not be  redeemed, we  recognize  the associated value proportionally as  the remaining mileage  credits  are  redeemed. Our  estimates  use  statistical models  based on  historical  redemption  patterns  to  develop  an  estimate  of  the likelihood  of  future  redemption.  For  the  year  ended  December  31,  2020,  a  hypothetical  10%  increase  in  our  estimate  of  miles  not  expected  to  be redeemed would have increased revenues by approximately $35 million.  Long-lived Assets Long-lived assets consist of owned flight and ground equipment, ROU assets and definite-lived intangible assets such as certain domestic airport slots  and gate  leasehold  rights, customer  relationships and marketing agreements.  In addition  to  the original cost,  the  recorded value of our  fixed assets  is impacted by a number of estimates made, including estimated useful lives, salvage values and our determination as to whether aircraft are temporarily or permanently grounded. The majority of our aircraft fleet types are depreciated over 25-30 years. It is possible that the ultimate useful lives of our aircraft will be significantly different than the current estimate due to unforeseen events in the future that impact our fleet plan. Definite-lived intangible assets are originally recorded at their acquired fair values and are subsequently amortized over their estimated useful lives.  Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 360 – Property, Plant and Equipment (ASC 360) requires long-lived assets to be assessed for  impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired. An impairment of a long-lived asset or group of  long-lived assets exists only when the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated directly by the assets are less than the carrying value of the assets. We group  assets  principally  by  fleet-type  when  estimating  future  cash  flows,  which  is  generally  the  lowest  level  for  which  identifiable  cash  flows  exist. Estimates of future cash flows are based on historical results adjusted to reflect management’s best estimate of future market and operating conditions, including our current fleet plan. If such assets are impaired, the impairment charge recognized is the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value. Fair value reflects management’s best estimate including inputs from published pricing guides and bids from third parties as well as contracted sales agreements when applicable.  84    Table of Contents  In 2020, our operations, liquidity and stock price were significantly impacted by decreased passenger demand and government travel restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, we decided to retire certain mainline aircraft earlier than planned, including Airbus A330-200, Boeing 757, Boeing 767, Airbus A330-300 and Embraer 190 aircraft as well as regional aircraft, including certain Embraer 140 and Bombardier CRJ200 aircraft. As a result of these events and circumstances, we performed impairment tests for our long-lived assets in the first three quarters of 2020.  As  a  result  of  the  impairment  tests  performed  on  our  long-lived  assets,  we  determined  the  sum  of  the  estimated  undiscounted  future  cash  flows exceeded the carrying value for our long-lived assets except for the aircraft being retired earlier than planned as discussed above. For those aircraft and certain related spare parts, we recorded impairment charges reflecting the difference between the carrying values of these assets and their fair values of $1.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020. Due to the inherent uncertainties of the current operating environment, we will continue to evaluate our current fleet (including aircraft in temporary storage) and may decide to permanently retire additional aircraft.  Goodwill and Indefinite-lived Assets Goodwill represents the purchase price in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with the merger with  US  Airways  Group.  We  have  one  reporting  unit.  Indefinite-lived  intangible  assets  other  than  goodwill  consist  of  certain  domestic  airport  slots  and international slots and route authorities. ASC 350 – Intangibles – Goodwill and Other (ASC 350) requires goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets to be assessed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the fair values of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets may be lower than their carrying values. Our annual assessment date is October 1.  Goodwill  and  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets  are  assessed  for  impairment  by  initially  performing  a  qualitative  assessment.  Under  the  qualitative approach, we analyze the following factors, among others, to determine if events or circumstances have affected the fair value of goodwill and indefinite- lived  intangible assets:  (1) negative trends  in our market capitalization,  (2) an  increase  in  fuel prices,  (3) declining per mile passenger yields,  (4)  lower passenger demand as a result of a weakened U.S. and global economy and (5) changes to the regulatory environment. If we determine that  it  is more likely than not that our goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets may be impaired, we use a quantitative approach to assess the asset’s fair value and the amount of the impairment, if any.  In addition to our annual impairment assessment, we performed interim impairment tests in 2020 on our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets as  a  result  of  the  events  and  circumstances  previously  discussed  due  to  the  impact  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  on  our  business.  For  goodwill,  we performed a quantitative analysis by using a market approach. Under the market approach, the fair value of the reporting unit was determined based on quoted market prices for equity and the fair value of debt as described in Note 9 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A and Note 7 to American’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B. The fair value exceeded the carrying value of the reporting unit, and our $4.1 billion of goodwill was not impaired.  We performed qualitative impairment tests on our $1.8 billion of indefinite-lived intangible assets and determined there was no material impairment.  As discussed above, due to the inherent uncertainties of the current operating environment, we will continue to evaluate our goodwill and indefinite- lived intangible assets for events or circumstances that indicate that their fair values may be lower than their carrying values.  Pensions and Retiree Medical and Other Postretirement Benefits We recognize  the  funded status  (i.e.,  the difference between  the  fair value of plan assets and  the projected benefit obligations) of our pension and  retiree  medical  and  other  postretirement  benefits  plans  in  the  consolidated  balance  sheets  with  a  corresponding  adjustment  to  accumulated  other comprehensive income (loss).  85    Table of Contents  Our  pension  and  retiree  medical  and  other  postretirement  benefits  costs  and  liabilities  are  calculated  using  various  actuarial  assumptions  and methodologies. We use certain assumptions including, but not limited to, the selection of the: (1) discount rate and (2) expected return on plan assets (as discussed below). These assumptions as of December 31 were:  2020 2019 Pension weighted average discount rate  2.7 % 3.4 % Retiree medical and other postretirement benefits weighted average discount rate  2.4 % 3.3 % Expected rate of return on plan assets  8.0 % 8.0 %  When establishing our discount rate to measure our obligations, we match high quality corporate bonds available in the marketplace whose cash flows approximate our projected benefit disbursements. Lowering the discount rate by 50 basis points as of December 31, 2020 would increase our pension and retiree medical and other postretirement benefits obligations by approximately $1.4 billion and $45 million, respectively, decrease estimated 2021 pension expense by approximately $15 million and increase estimated 2021 retiree medical and other postretirement benefits expense by less than $1 million.  The  expected  rate  of  return  on  plan  assets  is  based  upon  an  evaluation  of  our  historical  trends  and  experience,  taking  into  account  current  and expected market conditions and our target asset allocation of 30% fixed income securities, 24% U.S. stocks, 22% alternative (private)  investments, 16% developed international stocks and 8% emerging market stocks. The expected rate of return on plan assets component of our net periodic benefit cost is calculated based on the fair value of plan assets and our target asset allocation. Lowering the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets by 50 basis points as of December 31, 2020 would increase estimated 2021 pension expense and retiree medical and other postretirement benefits expense by approximately $70 million and $1 million, respectively.  During  2020,  we  reviewed  and  revised  certain  economic  and  demographic  assumptions  including  the  pension  and  retiree  medical  and  other postretirement benefits discount rates and health care cost trend rates. The net effect of changing these assumptions for the pension plans resulted in an increase of $1.7 billion  in  the projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2020. The net effect of changing these assumptions for retiree medical and other postretirement benefits plans resulted in an increase of $80 million in the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at December 31, 2020. We also revised our mortality assumptions to incorporate the new improvement scale issued by the Society of Actuaries. This resulted in a decrease in our pension and retiree medical and other postretirement benefit obligations by $140 million and $1 million, respectively.  See Note 10 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A and Note 8 to American’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B for additional information regarding our employee benefit plans.  Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences  attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded net as noncurrent deferred income taxes.  Our ability to use our NOL Carryforwards depends on the amount of taxable income generated in future periods. We provide a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion, or all of our deferred tax assets, will not be realized. We consider all available positive and negative evidence and make certain assumptions in evaluating the realizability of our deferred tax assets. Many factors are considered that impact our assessment of  future profitability,  including conditions which are beyond our control, such as the health of  the economy, the availability and price volatility of aircraft fuel and travel demand.  We presently have a $34 million valuation allowance on certain net deferred tax assets related to state NOL Carryforwards. There can be no assurance that an additional valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets will not be required. Such valuation allowance could be material.  (1)  (1)  (2)  (1)  (2)  86    Table of Contents  Recent Accounting Pronouncements ASU 2016-13: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments This ASU  requires  the  use  of  an  expected  loss model  for  certain  types  of  financial  instruments  and  requires  consideration  of  a  broader  range  of  reasonable and supportable information to calculate credit loss estimates. For trade receivables, loans and held-to-maturity debt securities, an estimate of lifetime expected credit losses is required. For available-for-sale debt securities, an allowance for credit losses will be required rather than a reduction to the carrying value of the asset. We adopted this accounting standard prospectively as of January 1, 2020, and it did not have a material  impact on our consolidated financial statements.  ASU 2020-06: Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts In An Entity\\'s Own Equity (the New Convertible Debt Standard) The New Convertible Debt Standard simplifies  the accounting  for certain convertible  instruments by  removing  the separation models  for convertible  debt with a cash conversion feature and for convertible instruments with a beneficial conversion feature. As a result, more convertible debt instruments will be  reported  as  a  single  liability  instrument  with  no  separate  accounting  for  embedded  conversion  features.  Additionally,  the  New  Convertible  Debt Standard amends the diluted earnings per share calculation for convertible instruments by requiring the use of the if-converted method. The treasury stock method  is no  longer available. Entities may adopt  the New Convertible Debt Standard using either a  full  or modified  retrospective approach, and  it  is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2021. Early adoption is permitted for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2020. The New Convertible Debt Standard is applicable to our 6.50% convertible senior notes due 2025. We early adopted the New Convertible Debt Standard as of January 1, 2021 using the modified retrospective method to recognize our 6.50% convertible senior notes as a single liability instrument. As of January 1, 2021, we recorded a $415 million ($320 million net of tax) reduction to additional paid-in capital to remove the equity  component  of  the  6.50%  convertible  senior  notes  from  our  balance  sheet  and  a  $19 million  cumulative  effect  adjustment  credit,  net  of  tax,  to retained deficit related to non-cash debt discount amortization recognized in periods prior to adoption resulting in a corresponding reduction of $389 million to the debt discount associated with the 6.50% convertible senior notes. See Note 5(h) to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A for additional information on our 6.50% convertible senior notes.  ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The risk inherent in our market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in the price of fuel, foreign  currency exchange rates and interest rates as discussed below. The sensitivity analyses presented do not consider the effects that such adverse changes may have on overall economic activity, nor do they consider additional actions we may take to mitigate our exposure to such changes. Therefore, actual results may differ. See Note 8 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A and Note 6 to American’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B for additional discussion regarding risk management matters.  Aircraft Fuel Our operating results are materially impacted by changes in the availability, price volatility and cost of aircraft fuel, which represents one of the largest  single cost items in our business. Because of the amount of fuel needed to operate our business, even a relatively small increase or decrease in the price of  aircraft  fuel  can have a material  effect  on our  operating  results  and  liquidity. Market  prices  for  aircraft  fuel  can be  volatile, with market  spot  prices ranging from a low of approximately $0.37 per gallon to a high of approximately $2.35 per gallon during the period from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2020.  As of December 31, 2020, we did not have any fuel hedging contracts outstanding to hedge our fuel consumption. We do not currently view the market opportunities to hedge fuel prices as attractive because, among other things, our future fuel needs remain unclear due to uncertainties regarding air travel demand and any hedging would potentially require significant capital or collateral to be placed at risk. As such, and assuming we do not enter into any future transactions to hedge our fuel consumption, we will continue to be fully exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices. Our current policy is not to enter into transactions to hedge our fuel consumption, although we review that policy from time to time based on market conditions and other factors. Based on our 2021  forecasted  fuel  consumption,  we  estimate  that  a  one  cent  per  gallon  increase  in  the  price  of  aircraft  fuel  would  increase  our  2021  annual  fuel expense by $38 million.  87    Table of Contents  Foreign Currency We are exposed to the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the U.S. dollar value of foreign currency-denominated transactions. Our largest  exposure comes  from  the British pound sterling, Euro, Canadian dollar and various Latin American currencies, primarily  the Brazilian  real. We do not currently have a foreign currency hedge program. We estimate a uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the U.S. dollar from 2020 levels relative to each of the currencies in which we have foreign currency exposure would have resulted in a decrease in pre-tax income of approximately $56 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.  Generally,  fluctuations  in  foreign  currencies,  including  devaluations,  cannot  be  predicted  by  us  and  can  significantly  affect  the  value  of  our  assets located outside the United States. These conditions, as well as any further delays, devaluations or  imposition of more stringent repatriation restrictions, may materially  adversely  affect  our  business,  results  of  operations  and  financial  condition.  See Part  I,  Item  1A. Risk  Factors  – “We  operate  a  global business with international operations that are subject to economic and political instability and have been, and in the future may continue to be, adversely affected by numerous events, circumstances or government actions beyond our control” for additional discussion of this and other currency risks.  Interest Our earnings and cash flow are affected by changes in interest rates due to the impact those changes have on our interest expense from variable-rate  debt instruments and our interest income from short-term, interest-bearing investments.  Our  largest  exposure  with  respect  to  variable-rate  debt  comes  from  changes  in  LIBOR.  We  had  variable-rate  debt  instruments  representing approximately 40% of our total long-term debt at December 31, 2020. We currently do not have an interest rate hedge program to hedge our exposure to floating interest rates on our variable-rate debt obligations. If annual interest rates increase 100 basis points, based on our December 31, 2020 variable- rate debt and short-term investments balances, annual interest expense on variable-rate debt would increase by approximately $130 million and annual interest  income  on  short-term  investments  would  increase  by  approximately  $70  million.  Additionally,  the  fair  value  of  fixed-rate  debt  would  have decreased by approximately $590 million for AAG and $450 million for American.  On July 27, 2017,  the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority  (the authority  that  regulates LIBOR) announced  that  it  intends  to stop compelling banks  to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. The discontinuation date for submission and publication of rates for certain tenors of USD LIBOR (1- month, 3-month, 6-month, and 12-month) is currently under consultation by the ICE Benchmark Administration (the administrator of LIBOR) and may be extended  until  June  30,  2023.  It  is  unclear whether  new methods  of  calculating  LIBOR will  be  established  such  that  it  continues  to  exist  after  2021. Similarly,  it  is not possible  to predict whether LIBOR will  continue  to be viewed as an acceptable market benchmark, what  rate or  rates may become acceptable  alternatives  to  LIBOR,  or  what  effect  these  changes  in  views  or  alternatives  may  have  on  financial  markets  for  LIBOR-linked  financial instruments. While the U.S. Federal Reserve,  in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, has chosen SOFR as the recommended risk-free reference rate for the U.S. (calculated based on repurchase agreements backed by treasury securities), we cannot currently predict the extent to which this index will gain widespread acceptance as a replacement for LIBOR. It is not possible to predict the effect of these changes, other reforms or the establishment of alternative reference rates in the United Kingdom, the United States or elsewhere.  We may  in  the  future pursue amendments  to our LIBOR-based debt  transactions  to provide  for a  transaction mechanism or other  reference  rate  in anticipation of LIBOR’s discontinuation, but we may not be able to reach agreement with our lenders on any such amendments. As of December 31, 2020, we had $12.8 billion of borrowings based on LIBOR. The replacement of LIBOR with a comparable or successor rate could cause the amount of interest payable on our long-term debt to be different or higher than expected.  88    Table of Contents '"
