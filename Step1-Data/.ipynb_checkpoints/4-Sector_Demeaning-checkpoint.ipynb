       "'ITEM 1. BUSINESS Overview  American Airlines Group Inc. (AAG), a Delaware corporation, is a holding company and its principal, wholly-owned subsidiaries are American Airlines, Inc. (American), Envoy Aviation Group Inc. (Envoy), PSA Airlines, Inc. (PSA) and Piedmont Airlines, Inc. (Piedmont). AAG was formed in 1982 under the name AMR Corporation (AMR) as the parent company of American, which was founded in 1934.  AAG’s and American’s principal executive offices are  located at 1 Skyview Drive, Fort Worth, Texas 76155 and  their  telephone number  is 817-963- 1234.  Airline Operations Together with our wholly-owned regional airline subsidiaries and third-party regional carriers operating as American Eagle, our primary business activity  is the operation of a major network air carrier, providing scheduled air transportation for passengers and cargo through our hubs in Charlotte, Chicago, Dallas/Fort Worth,  Los Angeles, Miami,  New York,  Philadelphia,  Phoenix  and Washington,  D.C.  and  partner  gateways,  including  in  London, Madrid, Seattle/Tacoma, Sydney and Tokyo (among others).  Approximately 95 million passengers boarded our  flights  in 2020, a decrease  from approximately 215 million passengers  in 2019. During 2020, we experienced an unprecedented decline in the demand for air travel due to the impact of coronavirus (COVID-19). COVID-19 has been declared a global health pandemic by the World Health Organization and has surfaced in nearly all regions of the world, which has driven the implementation of significant, government-imposed measures to prevent or reduce its spread, including travel restrictions, testing regimes, closing of borders, “stay at home” orders and business closures. While the length and severity of the reduction in demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic is uncertain, our business, operations and financial condition in 2020 was severely impacted.  As  of December  31,  2020, we  operated  855 mainline  aircraft  supported  by  our  regional  airline  subsidiaries  and  third-party  regional  carriers, which operated an additional 544 regional aircraft. See Part I, Item 2. Properties for further discussion on our mainline and regional aircraft and “Regional” below for further discussion on our regional operations.  American is a founding member of the  oneworld  Alliance, which brings together a global network of 13 world-class member airlines and their affiliates, working together to provide a superior and seamless travel experience. See below for further discussion on the oneworld Alliance and other agreements with domestic and international airlines.  See Part  II,  Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – “2020  Financial Overview,”  “AAG’s Results  of  Operations”  and “American’s  Results  of  Operations”   for  further  discussion  of  AAG’s  and  American’s  operating  results  and  operating performance. Also,  see  Note  14  to AAG’s  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  in  Part  II,  Item  8A  and  Note  12  to American’s  Consolidated  Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B for information regarding operating segments and see Note 1(l) to each of AAG’s and American’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Items 8A and 8B, respectively, for passenger revenue by geographic region.  Regional Our regional carriers provide scheduled air  transportation under  the brand name “American Eagle.” The American Eagle carriers  include our wholly-  owned regional carriers Envoy, PSA and Piedmont, as well as third-party regional carriers including Republic Airways Inc. (Republic), SkyWest Airlines, Inc.  (SkyWest),  and  Mesa Airlines,  Inc.  (Mesa).  In  addition,  Compass Airlines,  LLC  operated  regional  jet  aircraft  for  us  during  2020;  however,  this arrangement ended in April 2020. Our regional carriers are an integral component of our operating network. We rely heavily on regional carriers to drive feeder traffic to our hubs from low-density markets that are not economical for us to serve with larger, mainline aircraft. In addition, regional carriers offer complementary service in many of our mainline markets. All American Eagle carriers use logos, service marks, aircraft paint schemes and uniforms similar to  those of our mainline operations.  In 2020, approximately 30 million passengers boarded our  regional  carriers’  planes, approximately 48% of whom connected to or from our mainline flights, a decrease from approximately 59 million passengers in 2019, due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.  ®  7    Table of Contents  Substantially all of our regional carrier arrangements are in the form of capacity purchase agreements. The capacity purchase agreements provide that all  revenues,  including passenger,  in-flight, ancillary, mail and  freight  revenues, go  to us. We control marketing, scheduling,  ticketing, pricing and seat inventories. In return, we agree to pay predetermined fees to these airl'"

       "'ITEM 1. BUSINESS  Overview      American Homes 4 Rent (“AH4R”) is an internally managed Maryland real estate investment trust (“REIT”) formed on October 19, 2012. American Homes 4 Rent, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership formed on October 22, 2012, and its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively, the “Operating Partnership,” our “operating partnership” or the “OP”) is the entity through which the Company conducts substantially all of our business and owns, directly or through subsidiaries, substantially all of our assets. References to the “Company,” “we,” “our,” and “us” mean collectively, AH4R, the Operating Partnership and those entities/subsidiaries owned or controlled by AH4R and/or the Operating Partnership. We are focused on acquiring, developing, renovating, leasing and operating single-family homes as rental properties. We commenced operations in November 2012.      AH4R is the general partner of, and as of December 31, 2020 owned approximately 85.9% of the common partnership interest in, the Operating Partnership. The remaining 14.1% of the common partnership interest was owned by limited partners. As the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, AH4R has exclusive control of the Operating Partnership’s day-to-day management. The Company’s management operates AH4R and the Operating Partnership as one business, and the management of AH4R consists of the same members as the management of the Operating Partnership. AH4R’s primary function is acting as the general partner of the Operating Partnership. The only material asset of AH4R is its partnership interest in the Operating Partnership. As a result, AH4R generally does not conduct business itself, other than acting as the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, issuing equity from time to time and guaranteeing certain debt of the Operating Partnership. AH4R itself is not directly obligated under any indebtedness, but guarantees some of the debt of the Operating Partnership. The Operating Partnership owns substantially all of the assets of the Company, including the Company’s ownership interests in its joint ventures, either directly or through its subsidiaries, conducts the operations of the Company’s business and is structured as a limited partnership with no publicly traded equity. One difference between the Company and the Operating Partnership is $25.7 million of asset-backed securitization certificates issued by the Operating Partnership and purchased by AH4R. The asset-backed securitization certificates are recorded as an asset-backed securitization certificates receivable by the Company and as an amount due from affiliates by the Operating Partnership. AH4R contributes all net proceeds from its various equity offerings to the Operating Partnership. In return for those contributions, AH4R receives Operating Partnership units (“OP units”) equal to the number of shares it has issued in the equity offering. Based on the terms of the Agreement of Limited Partnership of the Operating Partnership, as amended, OP units can be exchanged for shares on a one-for-one basis. Except for net proceeds from equity issuances by AH4R, the Operating Partnership generates the capital required by the Company’s business through the Operating Partnership’s operations, by the Operating Partnership’s incurrence of indebtedness or through the issuance of OP units.      As of December 31, 2020, the Company held 53,584 single-family properties in selected sub-markets of metropolitan statistical areas (“MSAs”) within 22 states, including 711 properties classified as held for sale, and 51,271, or 97.0%, of our total properties (excluding properties held for sale) were occupied. We have an integrated operating platform that consists of 1,447 personnel dedicated to property management, acquisitions, development, marketing, leasing, financial and administrative functions.      We believe we have become a leader in the single-family home rental industry by aggregating a geographically diversified portfolio of high-quality single-family homes and developing “American Homes 4 Rent” into a nationally recognized brand that is well-known for quality, value and tenant satisfaction and is well respected in our communities. Our investments may be made directly or through investment vehicles with third-party investors. We began adding newly constructed “built-for-rental” single-family properties to our portfolio in 2017 through our internal “AMH Development Program” and through acquisitions from third-party developers via our “National Builder Program.” Our objective is to generate attractive, risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders through dividends and capital appreciation.      We believe that we have been organized and operate in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under U.S. federal income tax laws for each of our taxable years commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2012, through the current taxable year '"

       "'ITEM 1. BUSINESS Overview  American Airlines Group Inc. (AAG), a Delaware corporation, is a holding company and its principal, wholly-owned subsidiaries are American Airlines, Inc. (American), Envoy Aviation Group Inc. (Envoy), PSA Airlines, Inc. (PSA) and Piedmont Airlines, Inc. (Piedmont). AAG was formed in 1982 under the name AMR Corporation (AMR) as the parent company of American, which was founded in 1934.  AAG’s and American’s principal executive offices are  located at 1 Skyview Drive, Fort Worth, Texas 76155 and  their  telephone number  is 817-963- 1234.  Airline Operations Together with our wholly-owned regional airline subsidiaries and third-party regional carriers operating as American Eagle, our primary business activity  is the operation of a major network air carrier, providing scheduled air transportation for passengers and cargo through our hubs in Charlotte, Chicago, Dallas/Fort Worth,  Los Angeles, Miami,  New York,  Philadelphia,  Phoenix  and Washington,  D.C.  and  partner  gateways,  including  in  London, Madrid, Seattle/Tacoma, Sydney and Tokyo (among others).  Approximately 95 million passengers boarded our  flights  in 2020, a decrease  from approximately 215 million passengers  in 2019. During 2020, we experienced an unprecedented decline in the demand for air travel due to the impact of coronavirus (COVID-19). COVID-19 has been declared a global health pandemic by the World Health Organization and has surfaced in nearly all regions of the world, which has driven the implementation of significant, government-imposed measures to prevent or reduce its spread, including travel restrictions, testing regimes, closing of borders, “stay at home” orders and business closures. While the length and severity of the reduction in demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic is uncertain, our business, operations and financial condition in 2020 was severely impacted.  As  of December  31,  2020, we  operated  855 mainline  aircraft  supported  by  our  regional  airline  subsidiaries  and  third-party  regional  carriers, which operated an additional 544 regional aircraft. See Part I, Item 2. Properties for further discussion on our mainline and regional aircraft and “Regional” below for further discussion on our regional operations.  American is a founding member of the  oneworld  Alliance, which brings together a global network of 13 world-class member airlines and their affiliates, working together to provide a superior and seamless travel experience. See below for further discussion on the oneworld Alliance and other agreements with domestic and international airlines.  See Part  II,  Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – “2020  Financial Overview,”  “AAG’s Results  of  Operations”  and “American’s  Results  of  Operations”   for  further  discussion  of  AAG’s  and  American’s  operating  results  and  operating performance. Also,  see  Note  14  to AAG’s  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  in  Part  II,  Item  8A  and  Note  12  to American’s  Consolidated  Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B for information regarding operating segments and see Note 1(l) to each of AAG’s and American’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Items 8A and 8B, respectively, for passenger revenue by geographic region.  Regional Our regional carriers provide scheduled air  transportation under  the brand name “American Eagle.” The American Eagle carriers  include our wholly-  owned regional carriers Envoy, PSA and Piedmont, as well as third-party regional carriers including Republic Airways Inc. (Republic), SkyWest Airlines, Inc.  (SkyWest),  and  Mesa Airlines,  Inc.  (Mesa).  In  addition,  Compass Airlines,  LLC  operated  regional  jet  aircraft  for  us  during  2020;  however,  this arrangement ended in April 2020. Our regional carriers are an integral component of our operating network. We rely heavily on regional carriers to drive feeder traffic to our hubs from low-density markets that are not economical for us to serve with larger, mainline aircraft. In addition, regional carriers offer complementary service in many of our mainline markets. All American Eagle carriers use logos, service marks, aircraft paint schemes and uniforms similar to  those of our mainline operations.  In 2020, approximately 30 million passengers boarded our  regional  carriers’  planes, approximately 48% of whom connected to or from our mainline flights, a decrease from approximately 59 million passengers in 2019, due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.  ®  7    Table of Contents  Substantially all of our regional carrier arrangements are in the form of capacity purchase agreements. The capacity purchase agreements provide that all  revenues,  including passenger,  in-flight, ancillary, mail and  freight  revenues, go  to us. We control marketing, scheduling,  ticketing, pricing and seat inventories. In return, we agree to pay predetermined fees to these airlines for operating an agreed-upon number of aircraft, without regard to the number of passengers on board.  In addition,  these agreements provide that we either reimburse or pay 100% of certain variable costs, such as airport  landing fees, fuel and passenger liability insurance.  Cargo Our cargo division provides a wide range of freight and mail services, with facilities and interline connections available across the globe. In 2020, we  expanded our cargo service and launched our first cargo-only flights since 1984 to transport critical goods, including the COVID-19 vaccine, between the U.S. and Europe, Asia and Latin America. We operated more than 5,200 cargo-only flights serving 41 destinations. These cargo-only flights have helped our customers move more than 167 million pounds of critical goods around the world amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.  Distribution and Marketing Agreements Passengers can purchase tickets for travel on American through several distribution channels, including our website ( www.aa.com), our mobile app, our  reservations centers and third-party distribution channels, including those provided by or through global distribution systems (e.g., Amadeus, Sabre and Travelport),  conventional  travel  agents,  travel management  companies  and  online  travel  agents  (e.g.,  Expedia,  including  its  booking  sites Orbitz  and Travelocity, and Booking Holdings, including its booking sites Kayak and Priceline). To remain competitive, we will need to manage our distribution costs and  rights  effectively,  increase  our  distribution  flexibility  and  improve  the  functionality  of  our  proprietary  and  third-party  distribution  channels,  while maintaining an industry-competitive cost structure. For more discussion, see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors – “We rely on third-party distribution channels and must manage effectively the costs, rights and functionality of these channels.”  In general, beyond nonstop city pairs, carriers that have the greatest ability to seamlessly connect passengers to and from markets have a competitive advantage. In some cases, however, foreign governments limit U.S. air carriers’ rights to transport passengers beyond designated gateway cities in foreign countries. In order to improve access to domestic and foreign markets, we have arrangements with other airlines including through the oneworld Alliance, other cooperation agreements, joint business agreements, and marketing relationships, as further discussed below.  Member of oneworld Alliance American  is  a  founding member  of  the  oneworld Alliance,  which  currently  includes  British Airways,  Cathay  Pacific,  Finnair,  Iberia,  Japan Airlines,  Malaysia Airlines,  Qantas Airways  (Qantas),  Qatar Airways,  Royal Air  Maroc,  Royal  Jordanian,  S7 Airlines  and  SriLankan Airlines.  Fiji Airways  is  a oneworld connect partner and Alaska Airlines is a  oneworld member elect, expected to join the  oneworld Alliance in 2021. The oneworld Alliance links the networks of member carriers and their respective affiliates to enhance customer service and provide smooth connections to the destinations served by the alliance, including linking the carriers’ loyalty programs and providing access to the carriers’ airport lounge facilities.  Cooperation and Joint Business Agreements American has established a  transatlantic  joint business with British Airways, Aer Lingus,  Iberia and Finnair, a  transpacific  joint business with Japan  Airlines  and  a  joint  business  relating  to Australia  and New  Zealand with Qantas,  each  of  which  has  been  granted  antitrust  immunity.  Joint  business agreements enable  the carriers  involved  to cooperate on  flights between particular destinations and allow pooling and sharing of certain revenues and costs, enhanced loyalty program reciprocity and cooperation in other areas. American and its joint business partners received regulatory approval to enter into  these  cooperation  agreements.  Joint  business  agreements  have  become  a  common  approach  among  major  carriers  to  address  key  regulatory restrictions typically applicable to international airline service, including limitations on the foreign ownership of airlines and national laws prohibiting foreign airlines  from  carrying  passengers  beyond  specific  gateway  cities.  Our  competitors,  including  Delta Air  Lines  and  United Airlines,  are  party  to  similar arrangements.  The business relationship under the transatlantic joint business benefits from a grant of antitrust immunity from the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) and was reviewed by  the European Commission (EC)  in July 2010.  In connection with  this  review, we provided certain commitments  to  the EC regarding,  among  other  things,  the  availability  of  take-off  and  landing  slots  at  London  Heathrow  (LHR)  or  London  Gatwick  (LGW)  airports.  The commitments accepted by the EC were binding for 10 years. In October 2018, in anticipation of the exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union (EU),  8    Table of Contents  commonly  referred  to  as Brexit,  and  the  expiry  of  the EC  commitments  in  July  2020,  the United Kingdom Competition  and Markets Authority  (CMA) opened an  investigation  into  the  transatlantic  joint business. We continue  to  fully cooperate with  the CMA and,  in September 2020,  the CMA adopted interim measures  that effectively extend  the EC commitments  for an additional  three years until March 2024  in  light  of  the uncertainty  created by  the COVID-19  pandemic.  The  CMA  plans  to  complete  its  investigation  before  the  interim measures  expire.  In  December  2020,  the  DOT  issued  its  final approval  for  the  inclusion of Aer Lingus, which  is owned by  the parent company of British Airways and  Iberia,  into  the  transatlantic  joint business and granted antitrust immunity.  Marketing Relationships To  improve access  to each other’s markets,  various U.S. and  foreign air  carriers,  including American, have established marketing agreements with  other  airlines.  These  marketing  agreements  generally  provide  enhanced  customer  choice  by  means  of  an  expanded  network  with  reciprocal  loyalty program  participation  and  joint  sales  cooperation. As  of  December  31,  2020, American  had  codeshare  and/or  loyalty  program  relationships  with Aer Lingus, Air Tahiti Nui, Alaska Airlines, British Airways, Cape Air, Cathay Pacific, China Southern Airlines Company Limited (China Southern Airlines), EL AL Israel Airlines, Etihad Airways, Fiji Airways, Finnair, GOL, Gulf Air, Hawaiian Airlines, Iberia, Interjet Airlines, Japan Airlines, Jetstar Airways, Jetstar Japan, JetBlue Airways Corporation (JetBlue), Korean Air Lines, Malaysia Airlines, Qantas, Qatar Airways, Royal Air Maroc, Royal Jordanian, S7 Airlines, Seaborne Airlines, SriLankan Airlines and Vueling Airlines.  In  2020,  we  entered  into  an  expanded marketing  relationship  with Alaska Airlines.  This  arrangement,  once  implemented,  will  expand  our  existing codeshare  relationship,  including  codeshare  on  certain  of  our  international  routes  from  Seattle-Tacoma  International Airport  (SEA)  and  Los Angeles International Airport  (LAX),  and will  provide  for  reciprocal  loyalty  program benefits  and  shared  lounge  access. Pursuant  to  federal  law, American  and Alaska Airlines submitted  this proposed arrangement  to  the DOT for  review. After  the DOT allowed the review period  to expire with no  further actions, American and Alaska Airlines commenced implementation of this arrangement.  Also,  in 2020, we announced our  intention  to enter  into a marketing  relationship with JetBlue. This arrangement, once  implemented, will  include an alliance agreement with  reciprocal  codesharing on domestic  and  international  routes  from New York  (John F. Kennedy  International Airport  (JFK),  La Guardia Airport  (LGA),  and Newark  Liberty  International Airport  (EWR))  and Boston  Logan  International Airport  (BOS),  and will  provide  for  reciprocal loyalty program benefits. The arrangement does not include JetBlue’s future transatlantic flying. Pursuant to federal law, American and JetBlue submitted this proposed alliance arrangement to the DOT for review. After American, JetBlue and the DOT agreed to a series of commitments, the DOT terminated its review of the proposed alliance. The commitments include growth commitments to ensure capacity expansion, slot divestitures at JFK and at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA) near Washington, D.C. and antitrust compliance measures. Beyond this agreement with the DOT, American and JetBlue will also be refraining from certain kinds of coordination on certain city pair markets. In addition to the DOT review, the U.S. Department of Justice  (DOJ)  and  the  New York Attorney General,  the Massachusetts Attorney General,  and  the Attorneys General  of  certain  other  state  and  local jurisdictions are investigating this proposed alliance, which remains ongoing. American and JetBlue intend to cooperate with those investigations, but are proceeding with plans to implement this alliance.  Loyalty Program Our  loyalty  program, AAdvantage ,  was  established  to  develop  passenger  loyalty  by  offering  awards  to  travelers  for  their  continued  patronage.  AAdvantage was named Best Elite Program in the Americas for  the ninth consecutive year at  the 2020 Freddie Awards, which are annual awards that recognize  the  world’s  most  outstanding  frequent  travel  programs.  AAdvantage  members  earn  mileage  credits  by  flying  on  American,  any oneworld Alliance airline or other partner airlines. For every dollar spent by flying on American, members earn five mileage credits, but Gold, Platinum, Platinum Pro and Executive Platinum elite status holders earn additional bonus mileage credits of 40%, 60%, 80% and 120%, respectively. Members also earn mileage credits by using the services of over 1,000 program participants, such as the Citi and Barclaycard US co-branded credit cards, and certain hotels and car rental companies.  All  travel  on  eligible  tickets  counts  toward  qualification  for  elite  status  in  the AAdvantage  program.  Mileage  credits  can  be  redeemed  for  free  or upgraded travel on American and participating airlines, membership to our Admirals Club  or for other non-flight awards from our program participants. Most travel awards are subject to capacity-controlled seating. A member’s mileage credit generally does not expire as long as that member has any type of qualifying activity at least once every 18 months. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we suspended the expiration of mileage credits through June 30, 2021 and eliminated mileage reinstatement fees for canceled award tickets. Elite members can enjoy additional  ®  ®  9    Table of Contents  benefits of  the AAdvantage program,  including complimentary upgrades, checked bags, and Preferred and Main Cabin Extra seats, as well as priority check-in, security, boarding and baggage delivery. We also made it easier for top-tier customers to earn AAdvantage elite status in 2020 and 2021 and extended 2020 AAdvantage status into early 2022 for all members.  Under our agreements with AAdvantage members and program partners, we reserve the right to change the terms of the AAdvantage program at any time and without notice, and may end the program with six months’ notice. Program rules, partners, special offers, awards and requisite mileage levels for awards are subject to change.  During 2020, our members redeemed approximately 7 million awards, including travel redemptions for flights and upgrades on American and other air carriers, as well as  redemption of car and hotel awards, club memberships and merchandise. Approximately 6% of our 2020  total  revenue passenger miles flown were from award travel.  See Part  II,  Item  7. Management’s  Discussion  and Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  and Results  of Operations  –  “ Critical Accounting  Policies  and Estimates” for more information on our loyalty program.  Industry Competition Domestic The markets  in which we operate are highly competitive. On most of our domestic nonstop  routes, we  face competing service  from other domestic  airlines,  including  major  network  airlines,  low-cost  carriers  and  ultra-low-cost  carriers  such  as Alaska Airlines, Allegiant Air,  Delta Air  Lines,  Frontier Airlines,  Hawaiian Airlines,  JetBlue,  Southwest Airlines,  Spirit Airlines  and United Airlines.  Between  cities  that  require  a  connection,  where  the major airlines  compete  via  their  respective  hubs,  competition  is  significant.  In  addition, we  face  competition  on  some of  our  connecting  routes  from airlines operating point-to-point service on such routes. We also compete with all-cargo and charter airlines and, particularly on shorter segments, ground and rail transportation.  On all of our routes, pricing decisions are affected,  in  large part, by  the need to meet competition  from other airlines. Price competition occurs on a market-by-market basis through price discounts, changes in pricing structures, fare matching, targeted promotions and loyalty program initiatives. Airlines typically use discounted fares and other promotions to stimulate traffic during normally weak travel periods, when they begin service to new cities, when they have excess capacity, to generate cash flow, to maximize revenue per available seat mile or to establish, increase or preserve market share. Most airlines will quickly match price reductions in a particular market, and we have often elected to match discounted or promotional fares initiated by other air carriers in certain markets in order to compete in those markets. In addition, so-called ultra-low-cost carriers, such as Allegiant Air, Frontier Airlines and Spirit  Airlines,  compete  in  many  of  the  markets  in  which  we  operate,  competition  from  these  carriers  is  increasing  and  several  new  entrants  have announced their intention to start up new ultra-low-cost carriers.  In addition to price competition, airlines compete for market share by increasing the size of their route system and the number of markets they serve. The American Eagle regional carriers increase the number of markets we serve by flying to smaller markets and providing connections at our hubs. Many of our competitors also own or have agreements with regional airlines that provide similar services at their hubs and other locations. We also compete on the basis of scheduling (frequency and flight times), availability of nonstop flights, on-time performance, type of equipment, cabin configuration, amenities provided to passengers, loyalty programs, the automation of travel agent reservation systems, onboard products, health and safety and other services.  International In addition  to our extensive domestic service, we provide  international service  to Canada, Mexico,  the Caribbean, Central and South America, Asia,  Europe, Australia and New Zealand. In providing international air transportation, we compete with other U.S. airlines, foreign investor-owned airlines and foreign  state-owned  or  state-affiliated  airlines.  Before  the COVID-19  pandemic,  competition  had  been  increasing  from  foreign  state-owned  and  state- affiliated airlines in the Gulf region. These carriers have large numbers of international widebody aircraft in service and on order and had been increasing service to the U.S. from locations both in and outside the Middle East. Service to and from locations outside of the Middle East was provided by some of these carriers under  so-called  “fifth  freedom”  rights permitted under  international  treaties which allow service  to and  from stopover points between an airline’s home country and the ultimate destination. Such flights, such as a stopover in Europe on flights to the United States, allow the carrier to sell tickets for travel between the stopover point and the United States in competition with service provided by us. We believe these state-owned and state-affiliated carriers in the Gulf region, including their affiliated carriers, benefit from significant government subsidies,  10    Table of Contents  which have allowed  them  to grow quickly,  reinvest  in  their  product and expand  their  global  presence. We expect  this  to  continue after  the COVID-19 pandemic subsides. Competition had also been increasing from low-cost airlines executing international long-haul expansion strategies, a trend we also expect to continue after the COVID-19 pandemic subsides and the delivery of planned, long-range narrowbody aircraft commences.  In order  to  increase our ability  to compete  for  international air  transportation service, which  is subject  to extensive government  regulation, U.S. and foreign carriers have entered into bilateral and multilateral marketing relationships, alliances, cooperation agreements and joint business agreements to exchange traffic among each other’s flights and route networks. See “Distribution and Marketing Agreements ” above for further discussion.  Our People The airline business  is  labor  intensive, and our team members are our most  important asset. The operational complexity of our business requires a  diverse team of personnel trained and experienced in a variety of technical areas such as flight operations, ground operations, safety and maintenance, customer service, and airline scheduling and planning. We believe that if we create an environment where our team members feel supported, they will take care of our customers and thereby support the success of our business. To do this, we must continue to build a diverse and inclusive environment, helping all team members reach their full potential and providing them with the right resources and support.  Talent Development We give our team members the tools, training and resources they need to do their best work and stay true to our purpose – caring for people on life’s  journey. We have a suite of programs aimed at helping our people develop the skills and experience to succeed in their roles and build rewarding, long- term careers within our company. Additionally, we’ve partnered with  leading online  learning platforms  to make professional development available on- demand to all our team members.  Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Cultivating an environment that celebrates diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) is a top priority for us, and we seek to create a workplace where diverse  perspectives  and  experiences  are welcomed  and  encouraged, where  team members  feel  comfortable  to  be  their  authentic  selves  and where we  are always learning from one another. In 2020, we:  • established the role of Chief Inclusion and Diversity Officer and created the DEI office within our talent function so that hiring and development is viewed through the lens of equity and inclusion;  • formed a team member experience organization to listen to the concerns of team members;  • launched an Executive Sponsorship Program whereby a group of 15 Black  leaders have been paired with an executive  leader  for a year-long mentorship program; this program will be scaled to an expanded audience starting in late 2021;  • created an implicit bias training program delivered to approximately 105,000 team members;  • launched an external community council composed of executives and a cross-section of Black community  leaders  to provide  feedback on our company initiatives; and  • formed a specialized customer relations team to listen to, resolve and learn from customer complaints of discrimination.  Our DEI goals include:  • diversifying our leadership team by establishing specific objectives and laying out a plan to achieve them, including by enhancing our recruiting, development and mentoring programs;  • providing additional learning opportunities beyond implicit bias to generate further education and awareness of diversity and inclusion matters; and  • pledging  to assist Black youth  in developing  job skills and expanding access  to well-paying careers as part of our overall  strategy  to  increase opportunities in our hub cities and Tulsa, Oklahoma, where our largest maintenance facility is based.  11    Table of Contents  Competitive Pay and Comprehensive Benefits We  offer  competitive  pay  and  comprehensive  benefits  that  support  the  physical,  emotional  and  financial  well-being  of  our  team members. We’re  committed to providing medical coverage that is both affordable and flexible along with health care navigation and support tools. Additionally, we launched a well-being program in 2020 to help team members and their families make lasting changes in four key areas: physical, emotional, financial and work.  Our internal recognition programs give team members and customers the opportunity to show their appreciation for a job well done. In 2019, our team members were recognized by customers, peers and company leaders more than 2.5 million times. Last year, we launched a new Nonstop Thanks program whereby team members award each other points for a job well done or as an expression of gratitude. Those points can be redeemed for items in an online catalog. Every quarter, hundreds of team members are nominated for the Chairman’s Award, the highest honor that we bestow upon our team members.  Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted  in a severe decline  in demand for our services.  In 2020, we moved quickly  to better align our costs with our  reduced schedule. In addition to other cost reduction measures discussed below, we suspended all non-essential hiring, paused non-contractual pay rate increases,  reduced  executive  and  board  of  director  compensation,  implemented  voluntary  leave  and  early  retirement  programs  and  decreased  our management and support staff team, including officers, by approximately 30%. In total, more than 20,000 team members opted for an early retirement or long-term partially paid leave.  Pursuant to the payroll support program (PSP1) established under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, as amended (the CARES Act), the U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) provided us with an aggregate of $6.0 billion of financial assistance in 2020. These funds were used to fund eligible salaries, wages and benefits of our team members. Due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, we involuntarily furloughed certain team members starting October 1, 2020.  Pursuant to the payroll support program (PSP2) established under Subtitle A of Title IV of Division N of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (PSP Extension Law), Treasury is to provide us financial assistance to be paid in installments expected to total at least $3.0 billion in the aggregate, of which $1.5 billion was received on January 15, 2021. Using these funds, we recalled the involuntarily furloughed team members covered by PSP2 and provided them with back pay to December 1, 2020. PSP2 includes restrictions on involuntary furloughs and reductions in employee pay rates and benefits through March 31, 2021.  On February 5, 2021, we informed approximately 13,000 U.S.-based team members of the possibility of a workforce reduction at their work location. We expect that any workforce reductions will take effect on or after April 1, 2021. In connection with this notification, we announced the reopening of the voluntary early out and long-term leave of absence programs for team members of certain represented workgroups. Eligible team members must opt in by February 26, 2021 for the early out program and March 12, 2021 for the voluntary leave program.  Our future success depends in large part on our ability to attract, develop and retain highly qualified management, technical and other personnel. For more discussion, see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors – “The loss of key personnel upon whom we depend to operate our business or the inability to attract and develop additional qualified personnel could adversely affect our business.”  Labor Relations In 2020, salaries, wages and benefits were our largest expense and represented 45% of our total operating expenses. As of December 31, 2020, we  had approximately 102,700 active full-time equivalent employees, approximately 84% of whom were represented by various labor unions responsible for negotiating the collective bargaining agreements (CBAs) governing their compensation and job duties, among other things.  12    Table of Contents  Labor relations in the air transportation industry are regulated under the Railway Labor Act (RLA), which vests in the National Mediation Board (NMB) certain  functions with  respect  to disputes between airlines and  labor unions  relating  to union  representation and CBAs. When an RLA CBA becomes amendable,  if either party  to  the agreement wishes  to modify  its  terms,  it must notify  the other party  in  the manner prescribed under  the RLA and as agreed by the parties. Under the RLA, the parties must meet for direct negotiations, and, if no agreement is reached during direct negotiations between the parties, either party may request that the NMB appoint a federal mediator. The RLA prescribes no timetable for the direct negotiation and mediation processes, and it is not unusual for those processes to last for many months or even several years. If no agreement is reached in mediation, the NMB in its  discretion may declare  that  an  impasse exists  and proffer  binding arbitration  to  the parties. Either  party may decline  to  submit  to  arbitration and  if arbitration is rejected by either party, a 30-day “cooling off” period commences. During or after that period, a Presidential Emergency Board (PEB) may be established, which examines  the parties’ positions and recommends a solution. The PEB process  lasts  for 30 days and  is  followed by another 30-day “cooling off” period. At  the end of  this “cooling off” period, unless an agreement  is  reached or action  is  taken by Congress,  the  labor organization may exercise “self-help,” such as a strike, and the airline may resort to its own “self-help,” including the imposition of any or all of its proposed amendments to the CBA and the hiring of new employees to replace any striking workers.  None of the unions representing our employees presently may lawfully engage in concerted slowdowns or refusals to work, such as strikes, sick-outs or other  similar  activity,  against  us. Nonetheless,  there  is  a  risk  that  employees,  either with  or without  union  involvement,  could  engage  in  one  or more concerted refusals to work that could individually or collectively harm the operation of our airline and impair our financial performance.  The following table shows our domestic airline employee groups that are represented by unions:  Union Class or Craft Employees  Contract  Amendable Date Mainline: Allied Pilots Association (APA) Pilots 13,400  2020 Association of Professional Flight Attendants (APFA) Flight Attendants 24,550  2019 Airline Customer Service Employee Association – Communications Workers of America and International Brotherhood of Teamsters (CWA-IBT)  Passenger Service 13,500  2020  Transport Workers Union and International Association of Machinists & Aerospace Workers (TWU-IAM Association)  Mechanics and Related 12,300  2025  TWU-IAM Association Fleet Service 16,600  2025 TWU-IAM Association Stock Clerks 1,750  2025 TWU-IAM Association Flight Simulator Engineers 140  2021 TWU-IAM Association Maintenance Control Technicians 190  2025 TWU-IAM Association Maintenance Training Instructors 50  2025 Professional Airline Flight Control Association (PAFCA) Dispatchers 470  2021 Transport Workers Union (TWU) Flight Crew Training Instructors 350  2021 Envoy: Air Line Pilots Associations (ALPA) Pilots 2,150  2024 Association of Flight Attendants-CWA (AFA) Flight Attendants 1,500  2020 TWU Ground School Instructors 10  2023 TWU Mechanics and Related 1,400  2020 TWU Stock Clerks 140  2020 TWU Fleet Service 3,800  2019 TWU Dispatchers 70  2025 Communications Workers of America (CWA) Passenger Service 4,850  2026  (1)  13    Table of Contents  Union Class or Craft Employees  Contract  Amendable Date Piedmont: ALPA Pilots 550  2024 AFA Flight Attendants 350  2019 International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT) Mechanics and Related 450  2021 IBT Stock Clerks 60  2021 CWA Fleet and Passenger Service 5,950  2023 IBT Dispatchers 30  2019 ALPA Flight Crew Training Instructors 30  2024 PSA: ALPA Pilots 1,750  2023 AFA Flight Attendants 1,150  2023 International Association of Machinists & Aerospace Workers (IAM)  Mechanics and Related 800  2022  TWU Dispatchers 60  2022  Represents approximate number of active employees as well as employees who opted for a voluntary partially paid leave as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic as of December 31, 2020.  Joint  collective bargaining agreements  (JCBAs) have been  reached with post-Merger employee groups,  including a new  five-year JCBA  ratified on March 26, 2020 by the TWU-IAM Association, which represents the mechanics and related, fleet service, stock clerks, maintenance control technicians and maintenance training instructors. Additionally, the post-Merger JCBAs covering our pilots and flight attendants are now amendable. JCBAs covering passenger service employees and dispatchers are also amendable.  Among  our wholly-owned  regional  subsidiaries,  the Envoy  flight  attendants,  Envoy mechanics  and  related,  Envoy  stock  clerks,  Envoy  fleet  service clerks, Piedmont flight attendants and Piedmont dispatchers have agreements that are now amendable and are engaged in traditional RLA negotiations.  For more  discussion,  see Part  I,  Item  1A. Risk  Factors  –  “Union  disputes,  employee  strikes  and  other  labor-related  disruptions,  or  our  inability  to otherwise maintain labor costs at competitive levels may adversely affect our operations and financial performance.”  Aircraft Fuel Our operations and financial results are materially affected by the availability and price of aircraft fuel, which represents one of the largest single cost  items in our business. Based on our 2021 forecasted mainline and regional fuel consumption, we estimate that a one cent per gallon increase in the price of aircraft fuel would increase our 2021 annual fuel expense by $38 million.  The  following  table  shows annual  aircraft  fuel  consumption and  costs,  including  taxes,  for  our mainline and  regional  operations  for  2020 and 2019 (gallons and aircraft fuel expense in millions).  Year Gallons Average  Price per Gallon  Aircraft  Fuel Expense  Percent of Total Operating Expenses  2020 2,297 $1.48 $3,402 12.3% 2019 4,537 2.07 9,395 22.0%  As of December 31, 2020, we did not have any fuel hedging contracts outstanding to hedge our fuel consumption. We do not currently view the market opportunities to hedge fuel prices as attractive because, among other things, our future fuel needs remain unclear due to uncertainties regarding air travel demand and any hedging would potentially require significant capital or collateral to be placed at risk. As such, and assuming we do not enter into any future transactions to hedge our fuel consumption, we will continue to be fully exposed to fluctuations  in aircraft  fuel prices. Our current policy  is not  to enter into transactions to hedge our fuel consumption, although we review that policy from time to time based on market conditions and other factors.  (1)  (1)  14    Table of Contents  Aircraft fuel prices have in the past, and may in the future, experience substantial volatility. We cannot predict the future availability, price volatility or cost of aircraft  fuel. Natural disasters (including hurricanes or similar events  in  the U.S. Southeast and on the Gulf Coast where a significant portion of domestic  refining capacity  is  located), political disruptions or wars  involving oil-producing countries, economic sanctions  imposed against oil-producing countries or specific industry participants, changes in fuel-related governmental policy, the strength of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies, changes in the cost  to  transport or store petroleum products, changes  in access to petroleum product pipelines and terminals, speculation  in  the energy futures markets,  changes  in  aircraft  fuel  production  capacity  or  competing  demand  for  fuel  from  other  transport  industries,  such  as  maritime  shipping, environmental concerns and other unpredictable events may result in fuel supply shortages, distribution challenges, additional fuel price volatility and cost increases in the future. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors – “Our business is very dependent on the price and availability of aircraft fuel. Continued periods of  high  volatility  in  fuel  costs,  increased  fuel  prices  or  significant  disruptions  in  the  supply  of  aircraft  fuel  could  have  a  significant  negative  impact  on consumer demand, our operating results and liquidity.”  Seasonality and Other Factors Due to the greater demand for air travel during the summer months, revenues in the airline industry in the second and third quarters of the year tend to  be greater than revenues in the first and fourth quarters of the year. General economic conditions, fears of terrorism or war, fare initiatives, fluctuations in fuel prices, labor actions, weather, natural disasters, outbreaks of disease and other factors could impact this seasonal pattern. Therefore, our quarterly results of operations are not necessarily indicative of operating results for the entire year, and historical operating results in a quarterly or annual period are not necessarily indicative of future operating results.  The COVID-19 outbreak, along with  the measures governments and private organizations worldwide have  implemented  in an attempt  to contain  the spread of this pandemic, has resulted in a severe decline in demand for air  travel, which has adversely affected our business, operations and financial condition  to  an  unprecedented  extent,  and  affected  the  traditional  seasonal  trends  of  the  airline  business. Measures  ranging  from  travel  restrictions, including testing regimes, “stay at home” and quarantine orders,  limitations on public gatherings to cancellation of public events and many others have resulted in a precipitous decline in demand for both domestic and international business and leisure travel.  Domestic and Global Regulatory Landscape General Airlines are subject  to extensive domestic and  international  regulatory  requirements. Domestically,  the DOT and  the Federal Aviation Administration  (FAA) exercise significant regulatory authority over air carriers.  The DOT, among other things, oversees and regulates domestic and international codeshare agreements,  international route authorities, competition and consumer protection matters such as advertising, denied boarding compensation and baggage liability. The Antitrust Division of the DOJ, along with the DOT in certain instances, have jurisdiction over airline antitrust matters.  The  FAA  similarly  exercises  safety  oversight  and  regulates most  operational matters  of  our  business,  including  how we  operate  and maintain  our aircraft.  FAA  requirements  cover,  among  other  things,  required  technology  and  necessary  onboard  equipment;  systems,  procedures  and  training necessary  to ensure  the continuous airworthiness of  our  fleet of  aircraft;  safety measures and equipment;  crew scheduling  limitations and experience requirements;  and many other  technical  aspects of  airline operations. Additionally,  our  pilots  and other  employees are  subject  to  rigorous  certification standards, and our pilots and other crew members must adhere to flight time and rest requirements. In 2021, the FAA is expected to issue a number of rules that will impact us, including regulations mandating certain rest requirements for flight attendants.  The FAA also controls the national airspace system, including operational rules and fees for air traffic control (ATC) services. The efficiency, reliability and capacity of the ATC network has a significant impact on our costs and on the timeliness of our operations.  The U.S. Postal Service has jurisdiction over certain aspects of the transportation of mail and related services.  15    Table of Contents  Airport Access and Operations Domestically, any U.S. airline authorized by the DOT is generally free to operate scheduled passenger service between any two points within the U.S.  and its territories, with the exception of certain airports that require landing and take-off rights and authorizations (slots) and other facilities, and certain airports that impose geographic limitations on operations or curtail operations based on the time of day. Operations at three major domestic airports we serve  (JFK  and  LGA  in  New  York  City,  and  DCA  near  Washington,  D.C.)  and  many  foreign  airports  we  serve  (including  LHR)  are  regulated  by governmental entities through allocations of slots or similar regulatory mechanisms that limit the rights of carriers to conduct operations at those airports. Each  slot  represents  the  authorization  to  land  at  or  take  off  from  the  particular  airport  during  a  specified  time  period.  In  addition  to  slot  restrictions, operations  at  DCA  and  LGA  are  also  limited  based  on  a  so-called  “perimeter  rule”  which  generally  limits  the  stage  length  of  the  flights  that  can  be operated from those airports to 1,250 and 1,500 miles, respectively.  Our ability to provide service can also be impaired at airports, such as Chicago O’Hare International Airport (ORD) and LAX where the airport gate and other facilities are currently inadequate to accommodate all of the service that we would like to provide, or airports such as Dallas Love Field Airport where we have no access to gates at all.  Existing  law also permits domestic  local airport authorities  to  implement procedures and  impose restrictions designed  to abate noise, provided such procedures and restrictions do not unreasonably  interfere with  interstate or foreign commerce or the national transportation system. In some instances, these restrictions have caused curtailments in service or increases in operating costs.  Airline Fares, Taxes and User Fees Airlines are permitted  to establish  their own domestic  fares without governmental  regulation. The DOT maintains authority over certain  international  fares, rates and charges, but only applies this authority on a limited basis. In addition, international fares and rates are sometimes subject to the jurisdiction of the governments of the foreign countries which we serve.  Airlines are obligated to collect a federal excise tax, commonly referred to as the “ticket tax,” on domestic and international air  transportation, and to collect other taxes and charge other fees, such as foreign taxes, security fees and passenger facility charges. Although these taxes and fees are not our operating expenses, they represent an additional cost to our customers. These taxes and fees are subject to increase from time to time. The CARES Act provided  for a  temporary  tax holiday  from collecting and  remitting certain government  ticket  taxes  for  tickets purchased between March 28, 2020 and December 31, 2020.  DOT Passenger Protection Rules The DOT regulates airline interactions with passengers through the ticketing process, at the airport and on board the aircraft. Among other things, these  regulations govern how our  fares are displayed online,  required customer disclosures, access by disabled passengers, handling of  long onboard  flight delays and reporting of mishandled bags. In 2021, the DOT is expected to implement a number of new regulations that will impact us, including disability rules for accessible lavatories and wheelchair assistance, and refunds for checked bag fees in the event of certain delays in delivery.  International International air  transportation  is subject  to extensive government regulation,  including aviation agreements between the U.S. and other countries or  governmental authorities, such as the EU and the United Kingdom. Moreover, our alliances with  international carriers may be subject  to the  jurisdiction and  regulations  of  various  foreign  agencies.  The  U.S.  government  has  negotiated  “open  skies”  agreements  with  130  trading  partners,  which  allow unrestricted route authority access between the U.S. and the foreign markets. While the U.S. has worked to increase the number of countries with which open skies agreements are in effect, a number of markets important to us, including China, do not have open skies agreements.  In  addition,  foreign  countries  impose  passenger  protection  rules, which  are  analogous  to,  and  often meet  or  exceed  the  requirements  of,  the DOT passenger protection  rules discussed above.  In  cases where  these  foreign  requirements exceed  the DOT  rules, we may bear additional  burdens and liabilities. Further, various foreign airport authorities impose noise and curfew restrictions at their local airports.  16    Table of Contents  Security Since shortly after the events of September 11, 2001, substantially all aspects of civil aviation security in the U.S. or affecting U.S. carriers have been  controlled or  regulated by  the  federal government  through  the Transportation Security Administration  (TSA). Requirements  include  flight deck security; carriage of  federal air marshals at no charge; enhanced security  screening of passengers, baggage,  cargo, mail,  employees and vendors;  fingerprint- based background checks of all employees and vendor employees with access to secure areas of airports; and the provision of certain passenger data to the  federal government and other  international border security authorities,  for security and  immigration controls. Funding  for  the TSA  is provided by a combination of air carrier  fees, passenger  fees and  taxpayer  funds. Customs and Border Protection, which,  like  the TSA,  is part of  the Department of Homeland Security, also promulgates requirements, performs services and collects  fees  that  impact our provision of services. Additionally, we have at times found it necessary or desirable to make significant expenditures to comply with security-related requirements while seeking to reduce their impact on our customers, such as expenditures for automated security screening lines at airports. Our international service further requires us to comply with the civil aviation security regimes imposed at the foreign airports we serve.  Environmental Matters Environmental Regulation The  airline  industry  is  subject  to  various  laws  and  government  regulations  concerning  environmental matters  in  the U.S.  and  other  countries. U.S.  federal  laws  that  have  a  particular  impact  on  our  operations  include  the Airport  Noise  and  Capacity Act  of  1990,  the  Clean Air  Act,  the  Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability  Act  (Superfund  Act).  The  U.S.  Environmental  Protection  Agency  (EPA)  and  other  federal  agencies  have  been  authorized  to  promulgate regulations that have an impact on our operations. In addition to these federal activities, various states have been delegated certain authorities under the aforementioned federal statutes. Many state and local governments have adopted environmental laws and regulations which are similar to or stricter than federal requirements.  Revised underground storage tank regulations issued by the EPA in 2015 have affected certain airport fuel hydrant systems, with modifications of such systems needed in order to comply with applicable portions of the revised regulations. In addition, related to the EPA and state regulations pertaining to storm water management, several U.S. airport authorities are actively engaged in efforts to limit discharges of deicing fluid into the environment, often by requiring airlines to participate in the building or reconfiguring of airport deicing facilities.  The  environmental  laws  to  which  we  are  subject  include  those  related  to  responsibility  for  potential  soil  and  groundwater  contamination.  We  are conducting investigation and remediation activities to address soil and groundwater conditions at several sites, including airports and maintenance bases. We presently anticipate that the ongoing costs of such activities will not have a material impact on our operations. In addition, we have been named as a potentially responsible party (PRP) at certain Superfund sites. Our alleged volumetric contributions at such sites are relatively small in comparison to total contributions of  all PRPs. Accordingly, we presently  anticipate  that  any  future payments of  costs at  such  sites will  not  have a material  impact  on our operations.  We  employ  an  environmental  management  system  that  provides  a  systematic  approach  for  compliance  with  environmental  regulations  and management of a broad range of issues including air emissions, hazardous waste disposal, underground tanks, and aircraft water quality.  Aircraft Emissions and Climate Change Requirements Efforts to transition to a low-carbon future have increased the focus by global, regional and national regulators on climate change and greenhouse gas  (GHG) emissions. We have taken a number of actions that mitigate the GHG emitted by our operations both en route and on the ground, such as:  • retiring older, less fuel-efficient aircraft and replacing them with new, more fuel-efficient aircraft, resulting in the youngest mainline fleet of any U.S. network carrier;  • reducing  fuel  consumption  through  operational  initiatives  such  as  single-engine  taxi,  optimal  planned  arrival  fuel  and  our  new  flight planning system;  • entering into an agreement with a leading producer of renewable fuels to purchase nine million gallons of sustainable alternative aircraft fuel over three years;  17    Table of Contents  • working with the FAA and vendors to facilitate efficient airspace procedures, which also reduces aircraft emissions;  • updating  our  fleet with  lightweight  interiors  including  seats  and  furnishings  and  replacing  existing  cargo  containers with  lighter weight versions;  • replacing older,  inefficient ground support equipment with new, more  fuel-efficient ground support equipment,  including alternative-fuel and electric powered equipment;  • purchasing renewable electricity to reduce indirect emissions associated with the production of the power we consume; and  • obtaining certification of certain of our buildings  to  the U.S. Green Building Council’s Leadership  in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) standard.  In  addition,  American  is  subject  to  the  requirements  of  the  Carbon  Offsetting  and  Reduction  Scheme  for  International  Aviation  (CORSIA),  an international, market-based emissions reduction program adopted by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) in 2016. CORSIA is intended to achieve carbon-neutral growth  in  the  international aviation sector  from 2021 through 2035 by requiring airlines  to compensate  for  the growth  in carbon dioxide (CO ) emissions, relative to a predetermined baseline, of a significant majority of international flights through the purchase of carbon offsets or the use of low-carbon fuels. For each year from 2021 through 2029, CORSIA requires each airline to compensate for the rate of growth of the CO  emissions of the aviation sector as a whole as determined by ICAO. Starting in 2030, CORSIA will require airlines to compensate for growth in CO  emissions using a  formula determined by  ICAO  that will  combine  the growth  in  aviation  sector  emissions and  the growth  in  the  individual  airline’s  emissions, with  the proportion of the latter rising from at least 20 percent over the period 2030-2032 to at least 70 percent over the period 2033-2035.  ICAO originally defined the baseline as the average emissions from covered flights in 2019 and 2020. However, due to the impact of the pandemic on air travel, in June 2020 ICAO determined to remove 2020 from the baseline for the first few years of CORSIA implementation (2021-2023). Accordingly, we do not expect to be required to purchase offset credits over that period, unless the recovery in demand for international travel is unexpectedly strong and exceeds that of 2019 in those years.  At this time, the costs of complying with our future obligations under CORSIA are uncertain, primarily because of the difficulty in estimating the return of demand for international air travel in the recovery from the pandemic. There is also significant uncertainty with respect to the future supply and price of carbon offset credits and sustainable or lower carbon aircraft fuels that could allow us to reduce our emissions of CO . In addition, as described above, we will not directly control our CORSIA compliance costs because our compliance obligations  through 2029 are based on  the growth  in emissions of  the global aviation sector and begin to incorporate a factor for individual airline operator emissions growth starting in 2030.

Impact of Regulatory Requirements on Our Business Regulatory  requirements,  including but not  limited  to  those discussed above, affect  operations and  increase operating costs  for  the airline  industry,  including our airline  subsidiaries,  and  future  regulatory developments may continue  to do  the  same  in  the  future. See Part  I,  Item 1A. Risk Factors – “Evolving data security and privacy requirements could increase our costs, and any significant data security incident could disrupt our operations, harm our reputation, expose us to legal risks and otherwise materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition,” “If we are unable to obtain and maintain adequate facilities and infrastructure throughout our system and, at some airports, adequate slots, we may be unable to operate our existing flight schedule and to expand or change our route network in the future, which may have a material adverse impact on our operations,” “Our business is subject to extensive government regulation, which may result in increases in our costs, disruptions to our operations, limits on our operating flexibility, reductions in the demand for air travel, and competitive disadvantages,” “The airline industry is heavily taxed,” “We are subject to many forms of environmental and noise regulation and may incur substantial costs as a result,” and “We are subject to risks associated with climate change, including increased  regulation  of  our  CO   emissions,  changing  consumer  preferences  and  the  potential  increased  impacts  of  severe  weather  events  on  our operations and infrastructure” for additional information.  2  2  2  2  2  18    Table of Contents  Available Information Use of Websites to Disclose Information Our website  is  located  at www.aa.com.
